        "\n",
        "[faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Notebook will guide you through the transcription or translation of a  video file (from Youtube/Google Drive) using Faster Whisper. You'll be able to explore most inference parameters or use the Notebook as-is to store the output and video audio in your Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **How to use**\n",
        "1. Read and understand the notebook. You should at the very least modify the **video selection section** to choose the video you wish to translate/transcribe\n",
        "2. Click Runtime -> Run all and wait for the notebook to do its magic, alternatively you may run the cells one by one and skip the Google Drive portion if you do not intend to use it\n",
        "3. A download prompt should appear once subtitles is ready, or check the 'Files' tab on the left for the output\n"

            "[00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,530]  Yeah, there's not a lot of cheese in here.\n",

            "[00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,410]  The financials.\n",

            "[00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880]  You didn't send us October, ending October.\n",
            "[00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,420]  Because October's not yet been finalised.\n",
            "[00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,660]  Because that happens, should come out this week.\n",
            "[00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,380]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,830]  So it's the most up-to-date.\n",

            "[00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,720]  Yeah.\n",

            "[00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,700]  No, because I saw that and I was like, oh, okay.\n",

            "[00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,220]  Okay, you should finish the...\n",

            "[00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,500]  I was just in November, October mode.\n",
            "[00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,500]  Is there anything particular on the minutes or action items that isn't going to be covered\n",
            "[00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,180]  through the general discussion?\n",
            "[00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:56,590]  Do you remember whether we said we're going to do the action items?\n",
            "[00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,150]  When we finished the meeting or...\n",
            "[00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,750]  Is that what...\n",
            "[00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,710]  Right, okay, then.\n",
            "[00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,700]  Financials then, September.\n",
            "[00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,060]  Year-to-date loss of 667,603.\n",
            "[00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:25,740]  Has it always said fair value adjustment above the net profit and loss?\n",
            "[00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,180]  No, it's because we're now looking at the consolidated financial statement.\n",
            "[00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,060]  So that fair value adjustment is something that comes in related to the building.\n",
            "[00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:41,440]  So it's because we're now looking at a consolidated set of the ACO1 and property.\n",
            "[00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120]  And the property, yeah.\n",
            "[00:08:43,120 --> 00:09:32,880]  The one item here on the cost of sales, I'm not sure what's...\n",
            "[00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,820]  So the revenue is down again, but the cost of sales line is significantly higher.\n",
            "[00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,510]  I'm not sure why that is.\n",
            "[00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,820]  But I just noticed it now.\n",
            "[00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:52,700]  You said 291% of the revenue has been survived because...\n",
            "[00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,660]  That's where that no-charge work comes in, is it?\n",
            "[00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,660]  Yeah, positive sales.\n",
            "[00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,500]  Because if it's done for a client, then...\n",
            "[00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:10,480]  What is cost of sales here?\n",
            "[00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680]  I'm saying no-charge work still hits cost of sales.\n",
            "[00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,000]  The sale is zero, but cost of sales is.\n",
            "[00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,680]  So that's why cost of sales is up and sales is down in this situation.\n",
            "[00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:50,220]  Is there anything else on the financials?\n",
            "[00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480]  Is there anything else on the financials?\n",
            "[00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,820]  Comments, observations, queries?\n",
            "[00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,070]  And then here's stuff we chose here.\n",
            "[00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,460]  Looking it up, they're back paid.\n",
            "[00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,600]  Sorry, we're on the data's review.\n",
            "[00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:49,060]  This is what I said earlier on.\n",
            "[00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,500]  We've just got 30 days.\n",
            "[00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,200]  Sorry, what's that you were saying?\n",
            "[00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,880]  No, I was ahead of you, so no problem.\n",
            "[00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,280]  No, no, I just said we're doing the data's now, so...\n",
            "[00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,680]  As far as your slot stands, as far as your slot stands,\n",
            "[00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800]  we're doing some normal stuff.\n",
            "[00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,070]  You're chasing that.\n",
            "[00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,800]  Well, the last communication was that they would add all of the...\n",
            "[00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,120]  What do you call those certificates?\n",
            "[00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,240]  And that we were supposed to be collecting it.\n",
            "[00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,360]  So I'll follow up with Michelle about withholding tax certificate.\n",
            "[00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,710]  Because the last communication I got was that PostNet was instructed by your office,\n",
            "[00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,710]  our office, to collect the two certificates.\n",
            "[00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,740]  But DHL was on the way to collect on behalf of PostNet.\n",
            "[00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,020]  That is the last that I've got.\n",
            "[00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,640]  I'm assuming that I'll follow up with Michelle and check if she's received them\n",
            "[00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,880]  or what's happening with those withholding tax certificates.\n",
            "[00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560]  Because that's what the amounts are.\n",
            "[00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,690]  It's just the withholding tax amounts.\n",
            "[00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,020]  So, just to go back to Manny, yes, we had meetings.\n",
            "[00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,220]  They've been chasing up the outstanding amounts.\n",
            "[00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,120]  The long, the old stuff, I've asked them to clear.\n",
            "[00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,920]  They've agreed to it, but they haven't yet got to it.\n",
            "[00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,310]  At the moment, Ruth will carry on following that up.\n",
            "[00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,020]  They did make a payment, and they're more or less clean.\n",
            "[00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,370]  So it is a bit confusing because of the two six amounts.\n",
            "[00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,420]  120 days, which is mostly covered by unallocated payment.\n",
            "[00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,420]  It's overcovered by the unallocated payment.\n",
            "[00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,940]  There's an excess of $25,000 everybody puts on it.\n",
            "[00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,410]  They're more focused at the moment on getting sign-off\n",
            "[00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,890]  from the old invoices and getting invoices back.\n",
            "[00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,990]  Are these still from when Michelle was here?\n",
            "[00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,710]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,910]  Yeah, I've got advance payment.\n",
            "[00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,590]  Has anybody heard from Michelle?\n",
            "[00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,020]  I spoke when we were there about two months ago.\n",
            "[00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,940]  We did the mobility demo, and asked Desiree in her house.\n",
            "[00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,860]  I think she has found a job.\n",
            "[00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,220]  No, I just wondered if we'd get a recommendation.\n",
            "[00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,820]  Apparently, well, not apparently, her husband passed away.\n",
            "[00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,540]  Michelle's husband?\n",
            "[00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,740]  Michelle's husband, yeah.\n",
            "[00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,300]  When was that?\n",
            "[00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,700]  I'm just looking at the date.\n",
            "[00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,490]  18th or 17th.\n",
            "[00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,770]  So that must be after our meeting.\n",
            "[00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,530]  Yeah, I meant to tell you, but...\n",
            "[00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,520]  How did you know?\n",
            "[00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,750]  Oh, because Sarah's best friend is related to him.\n",
            "[00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,660]  Yeah, Michelle's gone, Mervyn's gone, Warren's leaving at the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,540]  Is Mervyn gone?\n",
            "[00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,980]  Yeah, Warren's leaving at the end of the year apparently.\n",
            "[00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,260]  Something said the fan name.\n",
            "[00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,220]  Well, yeah, I mean, the new guy seems to be quite...\n",
            "[00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,700]  That's why Rochelle, you know, bumped heads.\n",
            "[00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,460]  And he's obviously...\n",
            "[00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,460]  Has his own style.\n",
            "[00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,740]  Yeah, and it's quite strong, I would think.\n",
            "[00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,960]  We had a good meeting with the new FT.\n",
            "[00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,540]  We still have an issue there that they want everything to be signed off before they pay it,\n",
            "[00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,610]  which is what's causing delays with payments of invoices for the ad hoc stuff.\n",
            "[00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,600]  Project stuff is kind of moving through okay,\n",
            "[00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000]  but anything ad hoc has to be signed off by everybody\n",
            "[00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160]  to say that they're happy before they pay it.\n",
            "[00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,930]  Yeah, but the thing is they take on...\n",
            "[00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,690]  I know, which is the sign-off, which is why we've spoken,\n",
            "[00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,910]  and we've expedited, and we've asked, and they still do.\n",
            "[00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,700]  I've asked that they pay, and then we'll sort it out,\n",
            "[00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,590]  but I think their processes are...\n",
            "[00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,590]  They're clean, they actually are...\n",
            "[00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,410]  I think they're about to move into 60 days,\n",
            "[00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,690]  so they're clean.\n",
            "[00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,030]  Their client is pretty clean, but it's basically...\n",
            "[00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,290]  You know, if they require those kind of terms,\n",
            "[00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,170]  then they have to negotiate those terms.\n",
            "[00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,010]  They can't just take those terms because of their internal processes.\n",
            "[00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,450]  They certainly wouldn't be able to do that with other large suppliers,\n",
            "[00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,250]  like Eskim.\n",
            "[00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,930]  I mean, you have to pay according to the terms.\n",
            "[00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,100]  So at this point, it's all nice,\n",
            "[00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,380]  and they're busy sorting it out,\n",
            "[00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:25,970]  so I wouldn't go into value.\n",
            "[00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,240]  We have sorted out all the old stuff.\n",
            "[00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,040]  We did get them to raise POs.\n",
            "[00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,840]  We've still got issues because Andres hasn't been around.\n",
            "[00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,100]  Apparently, and I don't know to how confidential he is,\n",
            "[00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,710]  he apparently had a heart attack some time in the past,\n",
            "[00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,790]  so I don't think...\n",
            "[00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,910]  Just told me about it.\n",
            "[00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,190]  I think it is confidential,\n",
            "[00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:56,290]  but they did pick up that when he went in for his hands,\n",
            "[00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,650]  and then they picked up that he's...\n",
            "[00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,360]  They picked up markers, and then they looked further.\n",
            "[00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,420]  They believe that in the past couple of weeks, month,\n",
            "[00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,140]  he had had a heart attack.\n",
            "[00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,780]  So he had had, but he's not doing good over time.\n",
            "[00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,380]  So at this point, he's still not...\n",
            "[00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,800]  He's back at work, but he's not responding to mails,\n",
            "[00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,670]  and the process they put in place is still in operation.\n",
            "[00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,460]  So we're still chasing the POs for the RTTs,\n",
            "[00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,420]  the rest of the stuff.\n",
            "[00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,380]  I see we did get a big payment through over the weekend.\n",
            "[00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,540]  $670,000.\n",
            "[00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,620]  So they did agree to most of the stuff,\n",
            "[00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,980]  and we're still busy chasing the rest with 3M.\n",
            "[00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,050]  So I think that stuff will be sorted.\n",
            "[00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080]  What was wrong with his hand muscle?\n",
            "[00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,700]  I haven't spoken to him.\n",
            "[00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,820]  You said something, but I...\n",
            "[00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,980]  He had, he went into some operation on his hand,\n",
            "[00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,670]  and then they picked up that there were\n",
            "[00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,370]  inflammation markers for two hours.\n",
            "[00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,930]  But as a fact, please treat us confidential,\n",
            "[00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,650]  which is possible.\n",
            "[00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,420]  But I haven't yet managed to speak to him.\n",
            "[00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,980]  And the stuff that we couldn't invoice,\n",
            "[00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,940]  because we didn't have...\n",
            "[00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,740]  No, we did that for you.\n",
            "[00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,460]  That's all done.\n",
            "[00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,780]  So we raised POs,\n",
            "[00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,850]  and then when it came to getting payment\n",
            "[00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,450]  for some of the stuff now,\n",
            "[00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,490]  because he wasn't there,\n",
            "[00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,090]  then we're getting queries,\n",
            "[00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,560]  and then we addressed it.\n",
            "[00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,080]  So the, sorry, the RTT stuff,\n",
            "[00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,620]  the first lot of RTT stuff we did get paid.\n",
            "[00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,140]  I think there's a second lot that still has got to be sorted out.\n",
            "[00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,100]  The Australia stuff has been a bit of a delay.\n",
            "[00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,340]  So the second step, we're waiting for POs,\n",
            "[00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,620]  but we've done the work or not?\n",
            "[00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,460]  We've just, we're about to raise an invoice.\n",
            "[00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,060]  Ruth is going to raise an invoice.\n",
            "[00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,970]  So the first lot we got the PO for it.\n",
            "[00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,200]  The Australia stuff we got POs for,\n",
            "[00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120]  but the payment hadn't come through yet\n",
            "[00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,000]  because we're waiting.\n",
            "[00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,350]  The sign-off because of cloud issues.\n",
            "[00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,950]  So I've not got sure of the current status\n",
            "[00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,150]  of what's happening.\n",
            "[00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,630]  But it's, I think it's all more,\n",
            "[00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,710]  pretty much under control for a period of time.\n",
            "[00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,170]  Getting clearly clear in this country.\n",
            "[00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:24,880]  I think we're better than the million balance.\n",
            "[00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,680]  Sorry?\n",
            "[00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600]  I think we're probably better than the million balance.\n",
            "[00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,240]  No, that's what I'm saying.\n",
            "[00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320]  We received a payment of $670.\n",
            "[00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,960]  So this is as at the 31st of October.\n",
            "[00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,640]  The payment came in over the weekend.\n",
            "[00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,900]  So I'm guessing they paid most of that 60-day payments,\n",
            "[00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,540]  sort of thing,\n",
            "[00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,310]  which was those POs that we raised.\n",
            "[00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,010]  And it's still showing a million.\n",
            "[00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:52,750]  It's still showing a million, yeah.\n",
            "[00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,030]  I looked at the bank statement.\n",
            "[00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,830]  I looked at the cash.\n",
            "[00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,820]  She might not have processed that yet.\n",
            "[00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,630]  She's had feedback there.\n",
            "[00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,510]  They will be paying.\n",
            "[00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,390]  All of our contacts there have left the building.\n",
            "[00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,840]  So she's now established contact with Philippoo.\n",
            "[00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,340]  She did finally get her response.\n",
            "[00:21:42,990 --> 00:22:10,850]  I'd say everything else is calm.\n",
            "[00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,130]  There's still a bit of a balance.\n",
            "[00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,580]  That was for procurement\n",
            "[00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,500]  and for, I think, workflow.\n",
            "[00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,380]  So I've been using that procurement ad hoc,\n",
            "[00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,700]  but I haven't had queries now for a while.\n",
            "[00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,320]  And I'm not sure what's happened to the workflow.\n",
            "[00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,680]  I'm saying I don't know if you want to write it off,\n",
            "[00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:44,500]  which is not who, if anybody, is taking over.\n",
            "[00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,180]  But 1% being for India?\n",
            "[00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,380]  Those are the two outstanding.\n",
            "[00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,040]  So are we going to ask them?\n",
            "[00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,820]  Are we going to ask them?\n",
            "[00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:17,940]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,940]  From my side, it's been useful having it around.\n",
            "[00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,140]  But, I mean, if we clear it out, we can clear it out.\n",
            "[00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:35,680]  That's 198286, the two-month implementation check.\n",
            "[00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:53,380]  I swear to God, it doesn't look good for me.\n",
            "[00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,780]  She says she's looking for work, maybe for India.\n",
            "[00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,380]  Do you look for work?\n",
            "[00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,260]  The workflow for India is there.\n",
            "[00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:08,420]  I'm not sure if she's looking for work at all.\n",
            "[00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420]  I've got Lydia giving me an e-mail.\n",
            "[00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,000]  But we can talk to her if it's something she wants.\n",
            "[00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,480]  Who's account?\n",
            "[00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320]  We can do it.\n",
            "[00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760]  Who's account managing NDI?\n",
            "[00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,590]  I take care of it.\n",
            "[00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,270]  So will you reach out and ask them about it?\n",
            "[00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,030]  She says she's the other guy.\n",
            "[00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,010]  So Suhail, are you going to reach out to Leslie?\n",
            "[00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:50,510]  And we should move on to sales.\n",
            "[00:24:51,070 --> 00:25:01,490]  OK, so for sales, first up is Imperial Truck Rental.\n",
            "[00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,530]  We have given them a service and workshop demo\n",
            "[00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,830]  with the hope to replace three-way fleet.\n",
            "[00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,870]  So originally, they were looking at just the rental side of things.\n",
            "[00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,950]  Then we managed to convince them to see a demo for the workshop side.\n",
            "[00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,350]  And so they're interested in that as well as the mobility.\n",
            "[00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,930]  They specifically wanted to pre- and post-delivery inspections\n",
            "[00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,690]  using the mobile phone.\n",
            "[00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,650]  Everyone liked what they saw.\n",
            "[00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:50,370]  The person whose decision it is is a guy called Stephanos.\n",
            "[00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:57,650]  And he prefers having an integrated system as opposed to two separate systems.\n",
            "[00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,090]  So that plays in our favor.\n",
            "[00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,930]  And they are just waiting for their head office in Dubai\n",
            "[00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,860]  to choose what the financial reporting system will be for Oracle.\n",
            "[00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860]  And then once that decision is made,\n",
            "[00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,220]  then we'll get the guy ahead.\n",
            "[00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,620]  So that, whilst it's moved forward, we're still waiting.\n",
            "[00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,500]  Then the next up is FAW.\n",
            "[00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:30,270]  This, I've managed to speak to one of the guys last week.\n",
            "[00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,870]  We're basically at risk of losing it to SAP\n",
            "[00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,190]  because SAP is in conversations with them at the moment.\n",
            "[00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:48,720]  But I've not had Daphne, the CFO, take my call in easy six weeks.\n",
            "[00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,120]  So that's concerning.\n",
            "[00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,600]  And is it business one they're looking at or full SAP?\n",
            "[00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,710]  It'll be full SAP.\n",
            "[00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760]  You see, they're on business one at the moment.\n",
            "[00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,480]  No, no.\n",
            "[00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,000]  They're on it and they have an extension.\n",
            "[00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,360]  It's not doing everything.\n",
            "[00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,640]  No, no, no, it's not.\n",
            "[00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160]  Or maybe they're going to expand it.\n",
            "[00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,100]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,220]  Well, it seems that that's the conversation that is being had\n",
            "[00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,260]  for SAP to take over everything.\n",
            "[00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,020]  But SAP doesn't have a WMS system like what we do.\n",
            "[00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,780]  And the biggest push right now is on the WMS side.\n",
            "[00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,730]  So I'm a bit concerned about that.\n",
            "[00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,810]  But I will keep pushing.\n",
            "[00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:31,630]  And I'll also send an email to the effect that SAP does not have a WMS.\n",
            "[00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,220]  And of course, SAP didn't have a manned bus and truck case study on their website either,\n",
            "[00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,740]  which is what brought them to us.\n",
            "[00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,700]  The 60 users that you've got listed on the point of sale, is that the dealer users?\n",
            "[00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,040]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,480]  I don't have a dealer user column.\n",
            "[00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,600]  I can add one in if you want.\n",
            "[00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,400]  No, no, no, no, no, no.\n",
            "[00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,620]  It's just clarity.\n",
            "[00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,900]  And then the next up is OneLogix.\n",
            "[00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:12,130]  So OneLogix is a huge, huge deal.\n",
            "[00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:19,460]  They basically, the guy that they had to manage the whole ERP project,\n",
            "[00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,000]  has now been given the MD role at a branch called Mulas.\n",
            "[00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,360]  And so now he's moved down there.\n",
            "[00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:35,090]  So now they're in the process of looking for another ERP project manager to come on board\n",
            "[00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,530]  so that they can start the project.\n",
            "[00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:42,210]  It's not something that they're going to rush into without an ERP project manager,\n",
            "[00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,090]  because they've got massive complexity and loads and loads of different systems\n",
            "[00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,650]  that they're using in their environment now.\n",
            "[00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,570]  So yeah.\n",
            "[00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,370]  Not a Dave Mitchie.\n",
            "[00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:53,810]  And?\n",
            "[00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,850]  Not a Dave Mitchie.\n",
            "[00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,920]  Probably be well suited to it, because at the moment it's a lot of in-house developed stuff\n",
            "[00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,000]  and bespoke developed stuff and all of that,\n",
            "[00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,560]  which we're trying to find a solution that ticks all their boxes.\n",
            "[00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920]  What about Leon?\n",
            "[00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:09,810]  Sorry?\n",
            "[00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,850]  Leon Matthews?\n",
            "[00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,490]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,200]  Who thought of that?\n",
            "[00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,640]  I don't think he's really the right person, but he's the right person for our capacity.\n",
            "[00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:20,960]  For us.\n",
            "[00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,800]  Yes, absolutely.\n",
            "[00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,440]  Go Leon.\n",
            "[00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,380]  You see, you can sell it as a, rather take it as a contract,\n",
            "[00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:42,590]  you know, two, three year contract, because after that the new options are open.\n",
            "[00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,610]  You can either retain the person because of the value add or lose the cost.\n",
            "[00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,130]  It might be worth a conversation.\n",
            "[00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,290]  What was the big, not Leon.\n",
            "[00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,570]  Leon was the guy that we talked with originally, the other chappy.\n",
            "[00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,730]  Yes, it was David and Davi.\n",
            "[00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,770]  Davi, yes.\n",
            "[00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,380]  Yeah, Davi van de Merwe.\n",
            "[00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,330]  Okay, so.\n",
            "[00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,770]  SIKI is also a possibility.\n",
            "[00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,290]  There's changes happening at Tarsus.\n",
            "[00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,450]  I was going to talk about it when we get to the site,\n",
            "[00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,450]  but there's changes happening at Tarsus.\n",
            "[00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,900]  Reporting changes.\n",
            "[00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,140]  So SIKI will no longer be reporting to email.\n",
            "[00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,000]  At this point, he doesn't know who he's going to report to.\n",
            "[00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,310]  And he sent me a mail last week and said he's ready to move on.\n",
            "[00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,680]  If I can speak to any other clients, if I can find,\n",
            "[00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,560]  if I see anything over here, anything, you must please let me know.\n",
            "[00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,840]  Okay, we need to have that conversation.\n",
            "[00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,870]  So you can.\n",
            "[00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,220]  I think so.\n",
            "[00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,980]  Well, I definitely, there's the ERP from the project management.\n",
            "[00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,790]  Yeah, Tarsus currently, what you were saying to me Siki,\n",
            "[00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,670]  is that they're sitting on 200 million rands worth of stock\n",
            "[00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,510]  that is rapidly becoming obsolete.\n",
            "[00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,910]  They haven't made profits since July.\n",
            "[00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,640]  And they've rechanged as many people as they could in the house,\n",
            "[00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,360]  from the admin and the pickers.\n",
            "[00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960]  And now they're coming into the offices\n",
            "[00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,680]  to start the changement processes in the office.\n",
            "[00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,480]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,400]  You know, they never had stock.\n",
            "[00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,920]  It was so frustrating because they never ever had stock.\n",
            "[00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,720]  Then they...\n",
            "[00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,920]  Got too much of stock.\n",
            "[00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,480]  Yeah, they bought in stock, but probably the wrong stock.\n",
            "[00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,000]  You could have asked me.\n",
            "[00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,830]  I think the stock came late.\n",
            "[00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,510]  Remember in December, they had no stock.\n",
            "[00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,630]  It came late.\n",
            "[00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,470]  We got the ship delays and whatever.\n",
            "[00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,090]  They missed that whole December sales,\n",
            "[00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,900]  that Friday, November and December.\n",
            "[00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,540]  They missed all that.\n",
            "[00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,460]  So does Siki believe he's under threat\n",
            "[00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,300]  or is he just looking to get out the head of the hammer?\n",
            "[00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,140]  He doesn't believe he's under threat.\n",
            "[00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,340]  They did approach him\n",
            "[00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,220]  because they actually want to merge some of the IT departments.\n",
            "[00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,940]  So like the BI and the ERP,\n",
            "[00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,020]  you know, those ones where there's some synergy.\n",
            "[00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,580]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,240]  They want to merge those under a single person.\n",
            "[00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,800]  So they did approach Siki and ask him\n",
            "[00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,840]  if he would be interested.\n",
            "[00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840]  And he said, you know what?\n",
            "[00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,960]  He doesn't want to manage people\n",
            "[00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160]  where he doesn't know what they're doing.\n",
            "[00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720]  So if he can't stick with the ERP,\n",
            "[00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,560]  he doesn't want to do it.\n",
            "[00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,060]  I get it.\n",
            "[00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,840]  So, but they did ask him if he would put his head in the ring.\n",
            "[00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,280]  Yeah, but then he'll end up with Sagata also.\n",
            "[00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,880]  But then he ends up with people then.\n",
            "[00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000]  And now that's the concern.\n",
            "[00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880]  He was happy to report to some financial lady,\n",
            "[00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200]  but I don't think she's in the running at all anymore.\n",
            "[00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,800]  So now he doesn't know who he'll end up reporting to.\n",
            "[00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,720]  So the conversation that I had with him\n",
            "[00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,960]  about the exchanges and taskers,\n",
            "[00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,920]  that was in person.\n",
            "[00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,520]  The conversation about tasking clients\n",
            "[00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,800]  who are looking out for him,\n",
            "[00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,760]  that was over email.\n",
            "[00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,440]  I haven't spoken to him in person.\n",
            "[00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,640]  He sent it to me last week\n",
            "[00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,560]  and I just haven't had a chance to follow up.\n",
            "[00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,350]  Yeah, we can speak to him\n",
            "[00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,870]  if one of us sees something that...\n",
            "[00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,700]  And did he give any indication\n",
            "[00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,620]  if he was looking to move on,\n",
            "[00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,920]  who might take his role?\n",
            "[00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,740]  I haven't discussed any of that.\n",
            "[00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,420]  Like I said, that was just a conversation\n",
            "[00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,520]  over email with him.\n",
            "[00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,280]  I did say we, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,880]  ACS is always looking for bars.\n",
            "[00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,680]  So that's an opportunity, possibly.\n",
            "[00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,080]  And he said, yeah, no, he's happy to look at that\n",
            "[00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,480]  as long as it's viable for both of us,\n",
            "[00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080]  both parties, ACS and you.\n",
            "[00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,840]  That was his response to my response.\n",
            "[00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,290]  But we haven't had a conversation yet.\n",
            "[00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,500]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,840]  OneLogix is...\n",
            "[00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,810]  No, it's more towards the airport.\n",

            "[00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,550]  Imported vehicles inbound\n",
            "[00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,900]  and then export vehicles outbound.\n",

            "[00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,060]  And, yeah, that's a rinse and repeat\n",
            "[00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,660]  of OneLogix there.\n",
            "[00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,980]  But luckily, they've found their new\n",
            "[00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,860]  ERP manager to run with that.\n",
            "[00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,340]  So on, I think it's the 26th of this month,\n",
            "[00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,220]  we've got Warren,\n",

            "[00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,260]  and see a demo of Embrace.\n",
            "[00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,480]  So he literally just started,\n",
            "[00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,200]  I think, in week one of last month.\n",
            "[00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,600]  So he's still learning the names\n",

            "[00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,760]  But they're looking to go ahead\n",
            "[00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,520]  as soon as he's up and running.\n",

            "[00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,240]  So just this morning,\n",
            "[00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,300]  we resubmitted some pricing for them.\n",
            "[00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,480]  They don't want to rent\n",

            "[00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,640]  And they told us that we were twice\n",

            "[00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,320]  that we are up against.\n",
            "[00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,880]  So for the implementation side of things.\n",
            "[00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200]  And the hardware,\n",
            "[00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,480]  we were just out of the ballpark.\n",
            "[00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,640]  So they said, take the hardware out,\n",
            "[00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,720]  we'll get the hardware ourselves.\n",
            "[00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,480]  Because they've already got some QDAs\n",
            "[00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,240]  and what have you in their warehouse.\n",
            "[00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,880]  So they've got a supplier of sorts.\n",
            "[00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,640]  But then Ian and I took the opportunity\n",
            "[00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,160]  to just revise our pricing there\n",
            "[00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,680]  and resubmit a slightly lower price,\n",
            "[00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,120]  which I did just before coming into this meeting.\n",
            "[00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,890]  Which I think is an absolute blessing\n",
            "[00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,170]  because we were having the conversation\n",
            "[00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,450]  just a few weeks ago.\n",
            "[00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,850]  Out of all the times that we've lost the business,\n",
            "[00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,970]  not once has anyone ever come back to us\n",
            "[00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,170]  and said, you know what,\n",
            "[00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,650]  you're too expensive on this.\n",
            "[00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,530]  If you can just adjust this or do that,\n",
            "[00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,170]  we can allocate you the business.\n",
            "[00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,050]  Never once in the five years I've worked here.\n",
            "[00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,210]  So now we've taken the opportunity\n",
            "[00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,410]  to put in a slightly revised price there.\n",
            "[00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:51,030]  And fingers crossed, we'll see what happens.\n",
            "[00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,480]  But the decision to choose the WMS supplier\n",
            "[00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,000]  should take place this month.\n",
            "[00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,200]  You know, it should happen imminently.\n",
            "[00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,550]  Are you disconfident now with Hyrule?\n",
            "[00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,510]  No, I'm not.\n",
            "[00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,710]  The pause was due to them\n",
            "[00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,030]  wanting to enable the process,\n",
            "[00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,510]  which is fine.\n",
            "[00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,830]  But obviously I just want the process to happen faster.\n",
            "[00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,070]  You know, now that the new guys,\n",
            "[00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,940]  you started the beginning of, end of September?\n",
            "[00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,220]  Beginning of last month, October.\n",
            "[00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,180]  Yeah, so it was the end of September,\n",
            "[00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,540]  the 26th of September.\n",
            "[00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,100]  So we were hoping that if you'd hit the ground running\n",
            "[00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,380]  and we would pick up momentum.\n",
            "[00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,940]  But here's like, I'm new to the business,\n",
            "[00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,140]  I don't know the lay of the land,\n",
            "[00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,740]  I can't really evaluate.\n",
            "[00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,860]  So we were hoping to get something set\n",
            "[00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,200]  earlier in November.\n",
            "[00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,760]  We'll get the business.\n",
            "[00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,430]  It'll just come in a little later than a little sooner.\n",
            "[00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,850]  And then the next step is Econo Foods.\n",
            "[00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:07,190]  So Econo Foods is a nice sized deal.\n",
            "[00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:13,110]  It's 100 users, 42 WMS, and 108 point of sales.\n",
            "[00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,970]  So by far the largest deal that we've come across\n",
            "[00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,890]  since I've started here, with the exception of RentTech.\n",
            "[00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:30,260]  And so their CFO, Grant Hughes, reached out to me\n",
            "[00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,030]  and when we went down and demoed to them,\n",
            "[00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,910]  Grant was in the meeting,\n",
            "[00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:43,970]  but he had forgotten that it was us, you know,\n",
            "[00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,200]  us salespeople, you know,\n",
            "[00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,920]  we think that they'll remember our name the next day,\n",
            "[00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,560]  but they don't.\n",
            "[00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,870]  Didn't they have a problem with sales\n",
            "[00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,390]  and that's why this whole thing?\n",
            "[00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,830]  No, that was Jiguli.\n",
            "[00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,830]  So Econo Foods is one we probably saw\n",
            "[00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,430]  about two and a half years ago.\n",
            "[00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,110]  It was three years ago.\n",
            "[00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,990]  Three years ago.\n",
            "[00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,590]  No, so Jiguli is the one in Hardin.\n",
            "[00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,390]  These are the guys we flew down to Bloemfontein.\n",
            "[00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,040]  Yeah, why did it go quiet?\n",
            "[00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,560]  Because it was hot and then...\n",
            "[00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,160]  Yeah, it was hot and then they basically said\n",
            "[00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,960]  that no, they want to put a pause on this\n",
            "[00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,400]  for three years\n",
            "[00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,480]  because there were a whole bunch of stores opening.\n",
            "[00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,600]  I remember there was something I thought maybe...\n",
            "[00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,360]  They wanted to channel their capital\n",
            "[00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,160]  into new stores as opposed to new systems.\n",
            "[00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,200]  So now the fact that he's reached out to us,\n",
            "[00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,880]  whether he remembers us or not,\n",
            "[00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,840]  clearly they found us.\n",
            "[00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,120]  And so we have to stop the process.\n",
            "[00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,560]  Yeah, so I've touched base with Joseph,\n",
            "[00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,040]  who was the key contact from the last time,\n",
            "[00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,240]  and Graham Buiters, the MD.\n",
            "[00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,200]  So I've spoken to all three of them\n",
            "[00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,840]  and basically my last conversation with Grant\n",
            "[00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,880]  just on Thursday, this last week,\n",
            "[00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,470]  was that, look, we want to move ahead,\n",
            "[00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,670]  but we're going to start this project in the new year.\n",
            "[00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,910]  So I said, cool, if I've not heard from you\n",
            "[00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,750]  by week three in January, I'll give you a call\n",
            "[00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,950]  and we can schedule that meeting.\n",
            "[00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,390]  I think God knew we needed three years\n",
            "[00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,430]  to do Orms first.\n",
            "[00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,930]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,430]  Yeah, absolutely.\n",
            "[00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,870]  It's a smaller retail operation.\n",
            "[00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,370]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,190]  Can you imagine hitting that with all those stores\n",
            "[00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,030]  and not having inclusive pricing?\n",
            "[00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,090]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,390]  I think this would have been a train wreck.\n",
            "[00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:35,410]  So you've got 100 users, 40 W, and there's 100 Twitter.\n",
            "[00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,450]  100 points to sell there.\n",
            "[00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,810]  So how come we didn't reach out to them first?\n",
            "[00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,930]  It's been about three years.\n",
            "[00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:48,680]  It's literally a matter of timing\n",
            "[00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,440]  as to when it popped up in my diary.\n",
            "[00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,760]  Because when I went into my calendar\n",
            "[00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,360]  and I searched for them,\n",
            "[00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,400]  it was literally coming up\n",
            "[00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,480]  like now in November, mid-November.\n",
            "[00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,900]  So.\n",
            "[00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,160]  Should we not be doing like more regular,\n",
            "[00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,980]  you know, if they say three years,\n",
            "[00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,780]  should we not be?\n",
            "[00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,460]  At least two and a half years.\n",
            "[00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,740]  Well, or two.\n",
            "[00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,900]  Or maybe six months because things do change.\n",
            "[00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,580]  You know what, Dean?\n",
            "[00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,540]  I was fully on board with that line of thinking\n",
            "[00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,740]  for the first five years of me working here.\n",
            "[00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,600]  Now I've learned.\n",
            "[00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,200]  It's not something that if they say,\n",
            "[00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,400]  oh, give me two years,\n",
            "[00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,070]  you find them in like basically 20 months\n",
            "[00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,590]  as opposed to 24 months.\n",
            "[00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,030]  Then they say, no, no, you know,\n",
            "[00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,550]  let's speak in a year's time.\n",
            "[00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,270]  It's never a case of, I mean,\n",
            "[00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,630]  this is the one and only where it's been\n",
            "[00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,510]  as close to three years as can be.\n",
            "[00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:54,660]  But don't worry, I do schedule them in my calendar.\n",
            "[00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,740]  So you used to do it, but you stopped doing it.\n",
            "[00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,780]  And all of those cloud leads are piling up,\n",
            "[00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,340]  I'm just saying.\n",
            "[00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,520]  Hmm, I'm just asking.\n",
            "[00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,660]  So you've stopped doing it.\n",
            "[00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,270]  You used to do it, but you stopped doing it.\n",
            "[00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:19,560]  I've stopped doing it prior to the whatever date it was.\n",
            "[00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,240]  If they say call me in six months,\n",
            "[00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,200]  I call them in six months.\n",
            "[00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,640]  I'm not going to find them in four months\n",
            "[00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,400]  to try and, you know, get them all excited.\n",
            "[00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,510]  That doesn't work.\n",
            "[00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,390]  It comes down to time, resources and money.\n",
            "[00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,360]  And yeah, very rarely do you get all three,\n",
            "[00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,280]  all together.\n",
            "[00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,600]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,940]  But yeah, I still schedule them to follow up.\n",
            "[00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:56,600]  And then Humbanati, you know, Humbanati basically,\n",
            "[00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,570]  they've now changed their business model.\n",
            "[00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,620]  They are focusing more on short-term car rentals.\n",
            "[00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,940]  Now they're looking at, what's that thing called?\n",
            "[00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:15,810]  Rental car manager.\n",
            "[00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,290]  RCM.\n",
            "[00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,130]  RCM, yeah.\n",
            "[00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,730]  So we're going to integrate into that.\n",
            "[00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,250]  Well, when I spoke to Jake the first time,\n",
            "[00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,630]  the first time he called, he already made up his mind.\n",
            "[00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,270]  So he came in for the meeting with Grant and all that,\n",
            "[00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,110]  but he already made up his mind.\n",
            "[00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,430]  Then he and I had a meeting with RCM,\n",
            "[00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,310]  the guys from Australia.\n",
            "[00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,420]  He had lots of meetings with them before we saw all this stuff.\n",
            "[00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,940]  But to us, it was like, you know,\n",
            "[00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,340]  when he spoke to us, he says, it's the first time.\n",
            "[00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,300]  It wasn't the first time.\n",
            "[00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,140]  How come they had that great developer\n",
            "[00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,740]  and they were trying to do things?\n",
            "[00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,460]  That was the guys in Durban with Hilton.\n",
            "[00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,660]  So the Avis guys that came across wanted that.\n",
            "[00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,260]  They said if people could place their orders,\n",
            "[00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,140]  it's easier for them then.\n",
            "[00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,200]  So they even put that on a, that one.\n",
            "[00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,320]  So the Avis guys were pushing for an online portal.\n",
            "[00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,640]  That's where the Lima project sort of came in.\n",
            "[00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,180]  Then they brought Jake on board,\n",
            "[00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,540]  who comes from a rental background with Woodford.\n",
            "[00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,330]  Believe RCM is the system that he used to do.\n",
            "[00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,890]  RCM will have a portal, won't it?\n",
            "[00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,610]  Yeah, absolutely.\n",
            "[00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,100]  But he came in with a preconceived idea\n",
            "[00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,780]  of what solution they needed.\n",
            "[00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,900]  And it ticked all the boxes.\n",
            "[00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,300]  So yeah, they've sent us.\n",
            "[00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,940]  But it doesn't do ERP.\n",
            "[00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,180]  No, it doesn't do ERP.\n",
            "[00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,020]  They need Embrace to do the financials.\n",
            "[00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,940]  They need Embrace to do the asset management.\n",
            "[00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,720]  Their servicing portion is, dare I say, non-existent.\n",
            "[00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,000]  Yeah, they can schedule itself,\n",
            "[00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,800]  but they can't do the service.\n",
            "[00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,200]  They can say, here's your service reminders\n",
            "[00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,160]  at these kilometers.\n",
            "[00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,960]  That's all it does.\n",
            "[00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,240]  So everything else has to talk\n",
            "[00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,370]  or has to work with what we provide.\n",
            "[00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,050]  So it's a possibility.\n",
            "[00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,320]  But yeah, their APIs are quite light.\n",
            "[00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,310]  Yeah, the integrations are not going to be highly integrated.\n",
            "[00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:24,280]  Can you remember, I mean, it was Paragon.\n",
            "[00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,850]  They used a company in Australia to do,\n",
            "[00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,880]  obviously, it wasn't ASEAN.\n",
            "[00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,840]  I'm sure it was ASEAN.\n",
            "[00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,640]  It might well have been ASEAN.\n",
            "[00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,680]  I'm sure it was ASEAN.\n",
            "[00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,620]  Yeah, it was ASEAN.\n",
            "[00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,940]  Well, Jake says most of the competitors use ASEAN.\n",
            "[00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,990]  So that's why he looked at it.\n",
            "[00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,950]  That's what he says.\n",
            "[00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:47,590]  Interesting.\n",
            "[00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:51,190]  Yeah, I think Jake has his own personal agenda.\n",
            "[00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,350]  Personally, the fact that he's had...\n",
            "[00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,430]  Maybe he's going to Australia and then he'll get...\n",
            "[00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,540]  No, not so much that.\n",
            "[00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,940]  But I think it's a system that he's familiar with.\n",
            "[00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,020]  So I think he's come into this new role\n",
            "[00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,100]  and he's got, I think,\n",
            "[00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,860]  as a whole minority of acquired businesses,\n",
            "[00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,140]  they're all running on different platforms.\n",
            "[00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,860]  So he's got no single view of anything.\n",
            "[00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,060]  So he's, I think, going to his comfort position,\n",
            "[00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,740]  which is, I know that system will work\n",
            "[00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,020]  and I know it does this part well\n",
            "[00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,220]  and that's what we need to have.\n",
            "[00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,640]  And these systems, in his experience,\n",
            "[00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,200]  always coexist with an accounting system.\n",
            "[00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,840]  And so that's a very industry standard sort of model.\n",
            "[00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,120]  So he doesn't see it as being...\n",
            "[00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,600]  So yeah, the process moving along,\n",
            "[00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,400]  but I don't get the sense that RCM\n",
            "[00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,960]  have the capacity to drive a project like this.\n",
            "[00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,280]  When Jake came to see us last, he said\n",
            "[00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,800]  he wasn't looking to be the project manager on this thing.\n",
            "[00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,480]  But the reality is he does.\n",
            "[00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,280]  He does appear to have his paddle in,\n",
            "[00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,400]  but whether or not he can give all of his focus to it,\n",
            "[00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,960]  I don't know.\n",
            "[00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,020]  It puts us in that sort of funny position\n",
            "[00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,820]  where we could probably facilitate it,\n",
            "[00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,090]  but it's almost to our own detriment in some respects.\n",
            "[00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,650]  So that integration, would it be one way?\n",
            "[00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,940]  So it looks like it's going to be\n",
            "[00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,260]  a very small portion outbound from us\n",
            "[00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,500]  and a very small portion inbound from them.\n",
            "[00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,180]  So literally, we will get invoicing details from them\n",
            "[00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,660]  that we then just have to push into the right GL entries,\n",
            "[00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,940]  the right allocations,\n",
            "[00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,940]  and outbound from us would be anything to do\n",
            "[00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,100]  with the servicing of the vehicle maintenance costs.\n",
            "[00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,780]  Well, they couldn't even give them a chance.\n",
            "[00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,280]  So how are they going to take information from RCM?\n",
            "[00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,080]  Well, this is...\n",
            "[00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:45,720]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.\n",
            "[00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,000]  This will be the challenge.\n",
            "[00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,600]  The guy didn't say that he doesn't.\n",
            "[00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,800]  They don't know what to do.\n",
            "[00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,440]  We asked the questions about servicing\n",
            "[00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,080]  and they were sort of...\n",
            "[00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,760]  No, no, we do services.\n",
            "[00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,840]  Okay, just tell me the level of details you go into\n",
            "[00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,440]  just so we can compare functionality\n",
            "[00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,360]  and understand what the touch points would be.\n",
            "[00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,880]  And it was backpedal, backpedal.\n",
            "[00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,920]  We actually don't do it at all.\n",
            "[00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,490]  And then Jake came here for a subsequent meeting\n",
            "[00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,530]  after we'd met.\n",
            "[00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,050]  He was up in Jobbik and said he'd like to...\n",
            "[00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,190]  Anyway, so at that stage,\n",
            "[00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,550]  we'd said in the technical meeting,\n",
            "[00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,390]  share with us your API documentation\n",
            "[00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,350]  so that we can get a sense\n",

            "[00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,020]  which they did send,\n",
            "[00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,620]  but it wasn't shared with us initially.\n",
            "[00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,740]  Then Jake came here and he said,\n",
            "[00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,020]  well, we can't really talk in any level of detail\n",
            "[00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,380]  until we get this information,\n",
            "[00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,740]  which was finally shared,\n",
            "[00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,260]  I think, last week whilst I was away.\n",
            "[00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,900]  So I did cast my eye over it.\n",
            "[00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,330]  All of their integrations,\n",
            "[00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:41,480]  it's about contract management,\n",
            "[00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,480]  making a booking, converting a booking,\n",
            "[00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,600]  executing the booking.\n",
            "[00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,480]  There is nothing that talks to integrating\n",
            "[00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,950]  with an ERP system to push transactions out.\n",
            "[00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,430]  So they integrate into UDO and Xero,\n",
            "[00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,470]  which are their most common integrations.\n",
            "[00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,910]  So it's a very CSV type file upload,\n",
            "[00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,430]  I would expect, and nothing to.\n",
            "[00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,550]  So is it a one-way or a two-way?\n",
            "[00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,990]  Supposedly a two-way,\n",
            "[00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,230]  but a very, very light integration.\n",
            "[00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,150]  They'll be emailing us that CSV file.\n",
            "[00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,780]  And I think,\n",
            "[00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,300]  and it would appear that their plan\n",
            "[00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,460]  is to put the Hombanati onto the same system,\n",
            "[00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,020]  which they've got that cycle billing\n",
            "[00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,060]  and they've got all these things.\n",
            "[00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,190]  I would think there's a number of places\n",

            "[00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,330]  of Hombanati's requirements.\n",
            "[00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,010]  And I think that's where they're at at the moment.\n",
            "[00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,850]  I don't think they're going to use it\n",
            "[00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,970]  for the long-term.\n",
            "[00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,690]  It's only for this A-verse.\n",
            "[00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,130]  You think so?\n",
            "[00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,810]  Jake said he wanted it for everything.\n",
            "[00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:46,850]  Yeah, but when he finds it,\n",
            "[00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,210]  No, no, no, absolutely.\n",
            "[00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,770]  So this is where,\n",
            "[00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,930]  it's whether or not we drive that process\n",
            "[00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,490]  and the exposure of what really can and can't be done.\n",
            "[00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,140]  So we just said,\n",
            "[00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,740]  listen, to move the thing forward,\n",
            "[00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,260]  we need to have a budget allocated.\n",
            "[00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,940]  We need to understand the scope of what we're doing,\n",
            "[00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,020]  and then we can allocate resources\n",
            "[00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,860]  and understand who's driving the project.\n",
            "[00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,500]  And so he said,\n",
            "[00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,020]  no, no, you understand, that's great.\n",
            "[00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:19,060]  And I'm not aware if we've heard anything since.\n",
            "[00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,570]  Is Grant now out of the picture?\n",
            "[00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,090]  No, Grant is still there,\n",
            "[00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,450]  but I think he has,\n",
            "[00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,850]  I think to some extent,\n",
            "[00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,250]  been forced to relinquish control of this project\n",
            "[00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,770]  because they did the expansion\n",
            "[00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,530]  with the A-verse dealerships that they,\n",
            "[00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,410]  outlets that they acquired,\n",
            "[00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,810]  and they tried to shoehorn the race model\n",
            "[00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,250]  for Hombanati into those,\n",
            "[00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,570]  and it clearly hasn't been a success.\n",
            "[00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,830]  And so I think part of Jake's role is to rectify that.\n",
            "[00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,190]  And so Grant is,\n",
            "[00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:50,790]  when he first came to meet with us,\n",
            "[00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,590]  it was a case of,\n",
            "[00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,420]  can we come to the party and help him save face\n",
            "[00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,700]  in terms of the choice that he made\n",
            "[00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,060]  and where it's gotten him to.\n",
            "[00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,140]  And so we gave him the undertaking that we would.\n",
            "[00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,920]  If I look at the dynamic now,\n",
            "[00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,050]  Jake's driving the process,\n",
            "[00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,730]  and Grant has relinquished that control.\n",

            "[00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,360]  an alternative workable solution in place\n",
            "[00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,320]  for the A-verse people,\n",
            "[00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,840]  because they are looking to acquire\n",
            "[00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,800]  short-term rental organizations.\n",
            "[00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,840]  So from a risk,\n",
            "[00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,080]  they're already evaluating two other A-verse groups\n",
            "[00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,620]  that they want to buy,\n",
            "[00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,140]  two other dealerships that they want to buy.\n",

            "[00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,740]  they are backing.\n",
            "[00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,060]  They lost a lot of their corporate work,\n",

            "[00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,700]  and a lot of their short-term rental businesses\n",

            "[00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,820]  Because he's got the contract\n",

            "[00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,300]  I think A-verse is one of those,\n",
            "[00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,380]  it grew very quickly,\n",
            "[00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,180]  huge overheads,\n",
            "[00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:00,900]  all the rest of it,\n",

            "[00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,480]  it's not reformed,\n",
            "[00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,200]  whereas, like I said,\n",
            "[00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,560]  they are acquiring a targeted operation\n",
            "[00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,600]  in an area that's got a reasonable footprint.\n",
            "[00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,910]  Why A-verse wouldn't look to retain those,\n",
            "[00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:22,150]  but maybe they're just cutting off deadwood,\n",

            "[00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,840]  I mean, they've sent us the API.\n",

            "[00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,250]  and we have to do some test scenarios.\n",
            "[00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:53,970]  We can vary it.\n",
            "[00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,880]  We've got their 15-30 A-verse account.\n",
            "[00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,530]  We can see what they're sending us,\n",
            "[00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,570]  see how we're going to take them.\n",
            "[00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,790]  So, we'll do it through ADE.\n",
            "[00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,860]  So, the API is not an API?\n",
            "[00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,180]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,020]  I mean, you're saying CSP files.\n",
            "[00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,820]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.\n",
            "[00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,460]  It might be ADE.\n",
            "[00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,460]  We're going to be getting back in.\n",
            "[00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,540]  They don't want rental contracts on use.\n",

            "[00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,940]  So, we are literally going to get invoices.\n",

            "[00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,820]  So, it could be going through a SIN 4350.\n",

            "[00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,260]  and then see how we're going to do it.\n",

            "[00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,490]  but one of the questions was,\n",
            "[00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,770]  is the level of breakdown that they provide out of our SIN\n",
            "[00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:41,330]  aligned to the way Jake wants to report\n",

            "[00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,030]  but the invoices.\n",
            "[00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,070]  Yeah, all that that comes in.\n",
            "[00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,430]  Because if the invoice is just a total.\n",
            "[00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,390]  Just got a number there.\n",
            "[00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:04,790]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,550]  Because what am I getting billed for?\n",
            "[00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:10,550]  So we need to sit and talk to them and see where.\n",
            "[00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:15,350]  And the payments as well.\n",
            "[00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,870]  Because they said they're going to do the payments on that.\n",
            "[00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,360]  Pay?\n",
            "[00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,000]  Oh, yes.\n",
            "[00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,560]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,560]  If it's a cash, but if it's on account.\n",
            "[00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,200]  Yeah, and well, they said they do credit card.\n",
            "[00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,680]  I don't know what.\n",
            "[00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,240]  No, no, but that credit card, that's cash.\n",
            "[00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,000]  But if it's a corporate account,\n",
            "[00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,800]  then it would be,\n",
            "[00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,440]  I would have thought on embrace.\n",
            "[00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,160]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,690]  But from what they are saying.\n",
            "[00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:35,410]  They're saying they're going to.\n",
            "[00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,530]  The whole operation,\n",
            "[00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,010]  so there's going to be duplicated customer records,\n",
            "[00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,250]  credit management's going to happen over there.\n",
            "[00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,090]  So I don't think they've got a strong sense\n",
            "[00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,010]  of where the touch points are\n",
            "[00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,370]  and the separation of the systems.\n",
            "[00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,210]  So what's the point of even integrating\n",
            "[00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,810]  then it should be a general edge level,\n",
            "[00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,650]  except they probably haven't got a general edge.\n",
            "[00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,150]  Correct.\n",
            "[00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:55,650]  That's exactly it.\n",
            "[00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,530]  They don't have that.\n",
            "[00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,890]  They don't have a general edge level.\n",
            "[00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,250]  Which is why they work with an Udo or a Xero.\n",
            "[00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,730]  I guess because they're just shunting that stuff into the GL.\n",
            "[00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:09,410]  We can do the same,\n",
            "[00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,730]  but then is that what Humber mounting wants?\n",
            "[00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,370]  Probably not.\n",
            "[00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,850]  Well, and I think that's part of the challenge\n",
            "[00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,010]  is Jake's driving a process,\n",
            "[00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,810]  but I can see that him and Grant are going to knock heads.\n",
            "[00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,330]  You know, it's all friendly at the moment.\n",
            "[00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:21,650]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:22,930]  But we know Grant,\n",
            "[00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,050]  he just plays nature.\n",
            "[00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,120]  Till he gets that first email.\n",
            "[00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,960]  How he thanks the client,\n",
            "[00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,880]  who was sort of the internal\n",
            "[00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,000]  or the external guy that had been appointed\n",
            "[00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,040]  to do this review.\n",
            "[00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,920]  And so he got used and then Jake appeared.\n",
            "[00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,480]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,760]  So, yeah, it's,\n",
            "[00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,540]  I think it's,\n",
            "[00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,490]  I think Jake's got a clear plan.\n",
            "[00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,410]  I'm just not sure that everybody is rowing the same boat.\n",
            "[00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,050]  Same boat as you.\n",
            "[00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,010]  So we just,\n",
            "[00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,580]  we can't sit on the sidelines.\n",
            "[00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,700]  We have to be involved.\n",
            "[00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,380]  But we're meeting with Jake.\n",
            "[00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,420]  So Jake's going to say,\n",
            "[00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,540]  this is what we need,\n",
            "[00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,700]  but that's not necessarily the truth.\n",
            "[00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,820]  That's what I'm questioning.\n",
            "[00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,460]  Yes, no, no.\n",
            "[00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,180]  So as I said,\n",
            "[00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,660]  so we've had meetings with Jake and Grant.\n",
            "[00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,220]  We've had one meeting with just Jake.\n",
            "[00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,700]  And I would say at a point where we progress this thing\n",
            "[00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,140]  and start putting a budget together,\n",
            "[00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,420]  our engagement is going to include Grant\n",
            "[00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,100]  and communication to ensure that\n",
            "[00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,410]  we don't want to get caught at the crossfire.\n",
            "[00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,050]  It'll be Grant.\n",
            "[00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:19,610]  Because that's...\n",
            "[00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,810]  Grant will probably take more risk.\n",
            "[00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,390]  That's fine.\n",
            "[00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:26,870]  I just think it's,\n",
            "[00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,380]  if we deal with Jake in isolation,\n",
            "[00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,060]  we could be at risk of aligning ourselves with...\n",
            "[00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,590]  The wrong party.\n",
            "[00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,190]  Well, yes, a dissenting party,\n",

            "[00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,910]  So, yeah, it is a bit,\n",
            "[00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,950]  I don't want to say it's a mess.\n",
            "[00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:41,510]  It's just,\n",
            "[00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:42,630]  it's in a state of flux.\n",
            "[00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:46,950]  It hasn't really yet gotten any sort of direction.\n",
            "[00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,550]  And I'm not sure that we're in a position\n",
            "[00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,790]  to give it direction at this stage.\n",
            "[00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:53,990]  What does RCM do?\n",
            "[00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,910]  Gives them the bells and whistles\n",
            "[00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,910]  that they want to bite for that.\n",
            "[00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,270]  Because if we understand fully what that is,\n",
            "[00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:10,740]  then we can provide a custom dev quote.\n",
            "[00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,980]  So what RCM does,\n",
            "[00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,180]  they say an operation,\n",
            "[00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,860]  rental operation for short.\n",
            "[00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,580]  And because they're not in the ERP system,\n",
            "[00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,780]  they don't need as much information\n",
            "[00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,900]  as what we need from outside.\n",
            "[00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:22,940]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,500]  And it's on the web base,\n",
            "[00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,060]  it's online.\n",
            "[00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,500]  And they deal with all these...\n",
            "[00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,420]  Integrate into the travel agencies.\n",
            "[00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,620]  Travel agencies and whatever.\n",
            "[00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,420]  We don't,\n",
            "[00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,700]  so that's a big plus for them.\n",
            "[00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,860]  That's what they were looking for Lima Bean to do.\n",

            "[00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:37,980]  And six months,\n",
            "[00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,780]  that guy did nothing.\n",
            "[00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,760]  So if we can retain the long term,\n",
            "[00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,120]  then we lose nothing\n",
            "[00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,810]  because they'll still be on rental.\n",
            "[00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,370]  So now we're in danger of losing\n",

            "[00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,500]  But if we retain that,\n",
            "[00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,940]  then it's just more upside.\n",
            "[00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,620]  We likely would retain it\n",
            "[00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,060]  because the longer...\n",
            "[00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,980]  We would probably lose some of what we have.\n",
            "[00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,380]  Because remember,\n",
            "[00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:04,940]  they just,\n",
            "[00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,380]  they increased their user footprint\n",

            "[00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:06,410]  And the service side.\n",
            "[00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,250]  Because each can't do their own service.\n",

            "[01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,740]  walk around the warehouse.\n",
            "[01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,630]  So they were impressed with that.\n",

            "[01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:16,870]  just giving an inventory\n",
            "[01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,150]  and WMS demo\n",

            "[01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,800]  You'll have to keep track of it.\n",

            "[01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,900]  But that didn't last long.\n",
            "[01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,340]  Initially, but I'm not sure yet.\n",
            "[01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,620]  But he's either gone and changed and moved.\n",

            "[01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,670]  He's still consulting to someone.\n",
            "[01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,960]  So we need to talk to Annette\n",
            "[01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,360]  and see where Iker is.\n",

            "[01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:10,870]  She takes care of SNC.\n",
            "[01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,230]  Yeah, so she looks after SNC.\n",
            "[01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,950]  One of our wives.\n",
            "[01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,930]  So why don't I know this?\n",
            "[01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:17,850]  She hasn't got you?\n",
            "[01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:18,970]  She's what?\n",
            "[01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,940]  She's a consultant.\n",
            "[01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:23,370]  All righty.\n",
            "[01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:27,910]  Then next up is Multivac SA.\n",
            "[01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:34,040]  It's a 40-user site with 11 field service technicians.\n",
            "[01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,000]  We gave them a demo in the middle of October.\n",
            "[01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,800]  Went very well.\n",
            "[01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,520]  Unfortunately, the CFO wasn't able to make the meeting.\n",
            "[01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,980]  So now we have to wait for him to watch the 3R demo.\n",
            "[01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,660]  I don't think we do.\n",
            "[01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,580]  I think we should phone him and say,\n",
            "[01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,860]  we'll come down and present too.\n",
            "[01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,500]  He'll never watch it.\n",
            "[01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,820]  Yeah, and we're sitting waiting on him to come back.\n",
            "[01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:04,340]  So I would strongly suggest we plan to go down and rinse and repeat the demo.\n",
            "[01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,100]  Where are they?\n",
            "[01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,060]  Heidelberg.\n",
            "[01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,660]  I was just down the road from Benoni.\n",
            "[01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,580]  Just around the corner for pups.\n",
            "[01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:13,940]  Short left.\n",
            "[01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:15,900]  And then...\n",
            "[01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,020]  What do they do?\n",
            "[01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:26,740]  They've got machines that do packaging for meat packaging,\n",
            "[01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,900]  pharmaceutical packaging, the whole bang shoot.\n",
            "[01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,820]  So they import these packaging machines,\n",
            "[01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,820]  and then they basically sell them and service them.\n",
            "[01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,700]  And that's why they've got the 11 field service technicians,\n",
            "[01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,540]  because they're monster machines, as big as this table.\n",
            "[01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,140]  Can't drop them off for the service.\n",
            "[01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,180]  No, the technician has to go then.\n",
            "[01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,980]  So that's what they do.\n",
            "[01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,700]  Yeah, so when you go and get your steaks and stuff that are shrink wrapped\n",
            "[01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,140]  in that really tight thing, the machine does all of that.\n",
            "[01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:02,260]  So they do the machines and they sell the consumables as well.\n",
            "[01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,430]  It's a model to sell consumables.\n",
            "[01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,910]  And what's interesting is the warehouse is not particularly big,\n",
            "[01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,110]  but it is chock-a-block,\n",
            "[01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:18,470]  because they've got specific consumables for specific clients.\n",
            "[01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:21,430]  Because Woolworths trays are this size and that,\n",
            "[01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:25,110]  and they've got a specifically configured machine with specific dies\n",
            "[01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,590]  to their portions and all the rest of it.\n",
            "[01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:32,550]  The machines are all of a general sort of construction,\n",
            "[01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,030]  but every one is a bespoke configuration.\n",
            "[01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:41,780]  So it has a set of complexity there that is all German engineered stuff.\n",
            "[01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,740]  So they are the local.\n",
            "[01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:50,220]  So they run SAP overseas, but not viable cost-wise here.\n",
            "[01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,220]  And then the last one on the list there is BidVest.\n",
            "[01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:01,260]  They've reached out to us and had conversations with them.\n",
            "[01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,100]  They're basically putting the final touches on the RFP\n",
            "[01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,420]  and they'll send it through shortly.\n",
            "[01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:11,340]  So they were hoping to send it through by Friday this last week,\n",
            "[01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,820]  but they haven't sent anything as yet.\n",
            "[01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,780]  BidVest will meet 300 different BidVest companies.\n",

            "[01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:56,570]  is because we have data corruption\n",

            "[01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:01,300]  So we put that one in place\n",

            "[01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:24,820]  then it could land up quitting out of get branch\n",

            "[01:46:44,410 --> 01:46:45,770]  is the same with the lots.\n",
            "[01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:47,690]  When they started with lot control,\n",
            "[01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:48,970]  they didn't have lots.\n",
            "[01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:50,650]  Then they made everything lot one.\n",
            "[01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:53,610]  Then they changed things to other lots.\n",
            "[01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:56,980]  And at some point,\n",
            "[01:46:56,980 --> 01:47:00,500]  so that will create a lot of issues.\n",
            "[01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:03,060]  Then we now get that they've been logging out users.\n",
            "[01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:07,740]  At some point, Barry cleaned up two and a half thousand lots\n",
            "[01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:11,660]  and now they're saying they've got 2000 lots missing.\n",

            "[01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,540]  but currently we're now sitting\n",
            "[01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,780]  where we've got no arrays on the IM\n",
            "[01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:23,980]  and we've got LRs and LIs out of sync.\n",

            "[01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:30,120]  So the only way I can see to fix that lot\n",
            "[01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,440]  is to get them,\n",
            "[01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:35,160]  is to force balance it and get them to make it.\n",
            "[01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:39,860]  It obviously doesn't make anybody happy,\n",
            "[01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:43,670]  especially in a fast moving environment.\n",
            "[01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:46,390]  So I had suggested before\n",
            "[01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:48,900]  when I understood what Barry was doing,\n",
            "[01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:51,140]  Barry's doing the sort in the PIC.\n",
            "[01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,080]  Those lot programs are horrendous.\n",
            "[01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:58,580]  So I suggested doing the sort on the GRV\n",
            "[01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:02,470]  and then not having any customizations in the PIC\n",
            "[01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,720]  and then fixing all the old data\n",
            "[01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:08,040]  because that stuff has a metric style.\n",
            "[01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:11,000]  So we had that one in hand\n",
            "[01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,760]  but anyone was happy when I said we didn't basically have no charge\n",
            "[01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,040]  so I didn't bring that one up\n",
            "[01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:18,280]  and I thought we'd keep it for the next meeting.\n",
            "[01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:20,520]  So that's the one option we can say\n",
            "[01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:24,520]  we believe that the way that the sorting is working\n",
            "[01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,000]  is potentially problematic.\n",
            "[01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,080]  We will fix that at no charge\n",
            "[01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,320]  because I'm trying to work out how you negotiate.\n",
            "[01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:34,360]  No, but if we've written a program\n",
            "[01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,600]  and it's stripped all the arrays off the IM\n",
            "[01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:39,640]  that needs to be restored from backup and fixed urgently\n",
            "[01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,160]  because that's chaotic.\n",
            "[01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,440]  This is all fast moving stuff.\n",
            "[01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:43,800]  This stuff is moving in and out.\n",
            "[01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:46,600]  These lots are coming in and out.\n",
            "[01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,520]  How are they selling it if it's not on the way?\n",
            "[01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:49,640]  I don't actually know.\n",
            "[01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:52,060]  Barry was saying this morning\n",
            "[01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,180]  he doesn't know how they function\n",
            "[01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:57,190]  because the stuff is not hanging together.\n",
            "[01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:58,870]  The fast moving stuff is not hanging together.\n",
            "[01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:02,870]  I think that it's a huge problem\n",
            "[01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:06,090]  and I think that worries me.\n",
            "[01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:08,250]  It sounds like an absolute disaster.\n",
            "[01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:18,410]  So I do think it needs to be handled as a crisis\n",
            "[01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:20,730]  and I do think that we're at risk.\n",
            "[01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:23,670]  That's why I spoke to him\n",
            "[01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:26,230]  because if they're busy paying,\n",
            "[01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:28,870]  if we're busy charging them for everything that we've done,\n",
            "[01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:31,770]  it's not coming right.\n",
            "[01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:33,850]  And with Imperial,\n",
            "[01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:35,930]  who are basically wanting to put us out,\n",
            "[01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:39,370]  replace us with whatever standard they've got,\n",
            "[01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:41,980]  then I think we've got really good friends.\n",
            "[01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,900]  I mean, Henning and Dean, I think,\n",
            "[01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:46,780]  are both good friends and so is Hendrik.\n",
            "[01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:47,660]  But it does worry me.\n",
            "[01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:49,900]  When I was chatting to Barry today, he's been busy\n",
            "[01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,260]  and look, Barry's been overloaded.\n",
            "[01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,940]  He's been getting it from all sides.\n",
            "[01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:54,380]  We've had issues of value.\n",
            "[01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:55,500]  We've had issues.\n",
            "[01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,940]  We've been getting it filtered from Manny, yes,\n",
            "[01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,380]  and we've had stuff from Gekko.\n",
            "[01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:02,060]  So he's been filled with all of the stuff.\n",
            "[01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,960]  But Barry told me today that he was busy\n",
            "[01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:10,200]  helping Hendrik with his backups\n",
            "[01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,960]  because it turned out that, I don't know,\n",
            "[01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,260]  there's all sorts of backups found.\n",
            "[01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:17,740]  My feeling was, well, that shouldn't actually be the priority.\n",
            "[01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,960]  This should be the priority.\n",
            "[01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,120]  We actually need to keep focus on\n",
            "[01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:25,670]  what's critical that Barry is now starting to do.\n",
            "[01:50:25,670 --> 01:50:28,230]  You need to give Barry direction that this is,\n",
            "[01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:32,230]  I mean, I can tell you we can lose the whole site.\n",
            "[01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:35,590]  You saying putting it on site needing attention\n",
            "[01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:37,350]  quite rightly, it's...\n",
            "[01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:38,630]  But when did we start,\n",
            "[01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:40,950]  when did we pick up the arrays of being cleared?\n",
            "[01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:41,270]  I mean...\n",
            "[01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:43,510]  If the arrays are cleared on fast-moving items,\n",
            "[01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:44,470]  how are they functioning?\n",
            "[01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:45,350]  Well, that's my question.\n",
            "[01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:49,510]  I'm trying to understand if we got the right picture here.\n",
            "[01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:52,470]  Are we giving, are we being given the correct information?\n",
            "[01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:54,070]  Because it just...\n",
            "[01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:57,430]  The LIs and the LIs are not up to sea.\n",
            "[01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:59,110]  The LIs, those are correct.\n",
            "[01:50:59,110 --> 01:50:59,430]  Right.\n",
            "[01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:01,510]  We are able to rebuild the...\n",
            "[01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:04,950]  So it's the fields 88, 89...\n",
            "[01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:06,390]  Yeah, on the IM.\n",
            "[01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:08,550]  But if they're not on the IM, you can't sell it.\n",
            "[01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:09,350]  You can't sell it.\n",
            "[01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:12,230]  So how are they actually staying in business?\n",
            "[01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:15,110]  But didn't Barry write the program for them?\n",
            "[01:51:15,110 --> 01:51:16,070]  So we wrote the program.\n",
            "[01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:17,350]  Barry has done it.\n",
            "[01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:18,710]  The winners voted...\n",
            "[01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,630]  When I came in this morning, just before you arrived,\n",
            "[01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:24,150]  because I'd gone to ask him what...\n",
            "[01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:26,390]  Because they sent an email when I was away.\n",
            "[01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:29,140]  Like, something came through Wednesday, Thursday.\n",
            "[01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:31,620]  So I went to ask him what...\n",
            "[01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:32,980]  Who had done what about it?\n",
            "[01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,560]  And he said to me, no, nothing had been done yet.\n",
            "[01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:39,720]  They sent it to Manny...\n",
            "[01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:43,640]  They sent it to Manny and Barry about this 2,000 lots\n",
            "[01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,640]  and what are we doing about it.\n",
            "[01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:48,420]  We were copying it.\n",
            "[01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:49,140]  So I went to see...\n",
            "[01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,340]  I was copying it.\n",
            "[01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,960]  Yeah, we were both copying it.\n",
            "[01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:54,840]  So I went to see what had been done.\n",
            "[01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,160]  And what Barry basically said, no, he hadn't done anything.\n",
            "[01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,100]  He's been too busy with everything else.\n",
            "[01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:00,380]  That's what he told me.\n",
            "[01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:01,020]  That's like...\n",
            "[01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:03,260]  I understand he's busy.\n",
            "[01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:07,820]  But honestly, we can lose the site if they can't make sales.\n",
            "[01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:13,910]  So has Dina got a fixed program that she runs regularly\n",
            "[01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:17,270]  that rebuilds those arrays off of the NR and LI\n",
            "[01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:19,670]  and that's how they are able to continue trading?\n",
            "[01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:20,550]  That's my question.\n",
            "[01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:23,030]  There are running stuff that Barry has written\n",
            "[01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:24,390]  that does certain fixes.\n",
            "[01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:25,670]  Other things it can't fix.\n",
            "[01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:28,390]  But it doesn't appear to be fixing everything\n",
            "[01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:30,470]  and so things are bouncing backwards and forwards.\n",
            "[01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:34,650]  Which is why I came to you in the first place.\n",
            "[01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:39,130]  This thing needs a concerted effort.\n",
            "[01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:43,450]  It's not trying to fit it in between everything else\n",
            "[01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:45,610]  that's going on is too much.\n",
            "[01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:47,720]  It's not...\n",
            "[01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:49,210]  He's not...\n",
            "[01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:59,340]  So if somebody needs to account manage that...\n",
            "[01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:00,620]  If not Barry, then who?\n",
            "[01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:03,900]  Or does Barry need to be reliant on the other things he's doing?\n",
            "[01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:07,100]  Well, it's a bit difficult because he has done...\n",
            "[01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,640]  They just found a problem with the target, I think, for value.\n",
            "[01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,000]  So that was just as critical.\n",
            "[01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,720]  Because then we just rolled it out.\n",
            "[01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,080]  But they found a bug which appears to be standard package\n",
            "[01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:25,020]  which is where the JM key that we send through\n",
            "[01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,780]  to the subroutines appears to be wrong\n",
            "[01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:31,180]  if you don't log out to log in, you can be broken.\n",
            "[01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:33,100]  So the data we're generating to send\n",
            "[01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:35,830]  through the target interface was failing.\n",
            "[01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:39,670]  So that's also been critical.\n",
            "[01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,840]  That came out on Friday.\n",
            "[01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:47,160]  But then he told me about the other stuff he's doing\n",
            "[01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:50,620]  and that's what we're concerned about.\n",
            "[01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,500]  I didn't have a chance to talk to you.\n",
            "[01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:56,220]  This all came out in the last 15 minutes\n",
            "[01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:57,740]  before I came into the meeting\n",
            "[01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:00,300]  because I was just chatting to you before I walked in.\n",

            "[01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:14,090]  So yes, I'm saying that we do need to focus\n",
            "[01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,770]  on finding these issues.\n",
            "[01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:17,850]  And we did put effort into trying to find it\n",
            "[01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,740]  until they gave us more information.\n",
            "[01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:27,110]  Is it something that, I think, yes,\n",
            "[01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,030]  I think there is frustration on their side.\n",
            "[01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:31,110]  But we, like I said, in my opinion,\n",
            "[01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:32,470]  they will be working together with them.\n",
            "[01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:34,390]  They're working with us to find a solution.\n",
            "[01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:39,500]  So it's not, I don't think it's as dire\n",
            "[01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,680]  as what it's been made out.\n",
            "[01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,920]  I'm saying that it is important.\n",
            "[01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,920]  It is something that we will manage.\n",
            "[01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:52,500]  I don't know that Barry needs to be relieved of anything.\n",
            "[01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,580]  I just need to speak to him a little more\n",
            "[01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,340]  and reprioritize some stuff\n",
            "[01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:58,100]  and see if I can share the vote.\n",
            "[01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:01,860]  But why I said it needs to be clients needing attention\n",
            "[01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,420]  is because, yes, we may come to R&D\n",
            "[01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:07,940]  and ask for help investigating something.\n",
            "[01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:08,820]  Give us direction.\n",
            "[01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:09,780]  Give us some pointers.\n",
            "[01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:11,060]  Because we've tried various things.\n",
            "[01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:12,580]  We've got traces all over the show.\n",
            "[01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:14,740]  So, yes, I can tell you exactly\n",
            "[01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,340]  when that record went out of sync.\n",
            "[01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:18,980]  But why it went out of sync, I wouldn't know.\n",
            "[01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,490]  You know, stuff like that.\n",
            "[01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:26,500]  So, yes, I think it's still currently manageable.\n",
            "[01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:29,530]  I think the management team needs to be aware\n",
            "[01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:31,770]  of what's happening at GECA.\n",
            "[01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:33,370]  But I think it's manageable.\n",
            "[01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:36,010]  And I think support can still manage it at this point.\n",
            "[01:55:36,010 --> 01:55:37,770]  But I don't think it's something that we need\n",
            "[01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:43,780]  to completely prioritize people's workloads\n",
            "[01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:45,060]  and stuff like that.\n",
            "[01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:47,300]  That's my opinion.\n",
            "[01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:50,100]  But if it's been going on for six months, then it's fine.\n",
            "[01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:51,700]  But I'm saying they've been trading.\n",
            "[01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:52,980]  What I'm saying is they've been trading\n",
            "[01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,100]  during that six months.\n",
            "[01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:56,020]  We've been looking during that six months.\n",
            "[01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:57,140]  And we've got traces.\n",
            "[01:55:57,140 --> 01:55:58,180]  We've got all these things.\n",
            "[01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:00,580]  We've gotten more clues now.\n",
            "[01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:03,190]  Now we know that the branch is locked.\n",
            "[01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:05,270]  That's the next step.\n",
            "[01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:07,030]  Find out why is this branch being locked\n",
            "[01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:09,380]  periodically, randomly.\n",
            "[01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:12,170]  Is it in the customizations?\n",
            "[01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:13,210]  Because the customizations, like I said,\n",
            "[01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,570]  I think in the customizations work\n",
            "[01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:15,690]  because they use that thing.\n",
            "[01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:18,410]  That's what they're using when they're releasing\n",
            "[01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:20,730]  their stock 90% of the time.\n",
            "[01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:23,020]  So it's the one time that they're...\n",
            "[01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:25,370]  But there's a bug in the system.\n",
            "[01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:28,250]  And whether the bug is in standard or customization,\n",
            "[01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:31,690]  I can also say that all of our sites are using\n",
            "[01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:33,690]  these programs in standard so they work.\n",
            "[01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:35,610]  But there are bugs in there.\n",
            "[01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:37,610]  And there are bugs in customizations.\n",
            "[01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:39,210]  And it doesn't matter.\n",
            "[01:56:39,290 --> 01:56:43,210]  And it doesn't really matter where it is.\n",
            "[01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:44,490]  It's to find it and fix it.\n",
            "[01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:47,370]  But it only started happening\n",
            "[01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:49,050]  after this customization was put in.\n",
            "[01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:52,650]  That's what they've only started using...\n",
            "[01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:53,610]  They've changed the way...\n",
            "[01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:55,690]  There have been a lot of changes since April.\n",
            "[01:56:55,690 --> 01:56:57,690]  And they only started using lots since April.\n",
            "[01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:00,810]  So it's been an evolution.\n",
            "[01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:03,610]  And the way they did it was potentially problematic.\n",
            "[01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:07,530]  Putting everything that you're doing to lot one,\n",
            "[01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:08,490]  that's not a good move.\n",
            "[01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:10,810]  That would have created...\n",
            "[01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:13,850]  So they just decided they're gonna use lots\n",
            "[01:57:13,850 --> 01:57:14,730]  and they went off on it.\n",
            "[01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:15,290]  No, no, no, no.\n",
            "[01:57:15,290 --> 01:57:16,650]  They didn't go from there.\n",
            "[01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:17,610]  And they did it without.\n",
            "[01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:18,170]  It's not just...\n",
            "[01:57:20,170 --> 01:57:21,210]  I think that...\n",
            "[01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:25,610]  And even the sorting was not a one-off.\n",
            "[01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:27,290]  It was, again, it was an evolution.\n",
            "[01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,250]  They wanted to sort.\n",
            "[01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:30,250]  They wanted to pick by expiry.\n",
            "[01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:32,090]  So we changed to pick by expiry.\n",
            "[01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:33,690]  And the pick by expiry didn't work\n",
            "[01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:36,010]  because things were coming in\n",
            "[01:57:36,010 --> 01:57:37,610]  in the different sequences.\n",
            "[01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:38,650]  And so they were...\n",

            "[01:57:39,850 --> 01:57:41,130]  they're all the same expiry date,\n",

            "[01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:49,450]  And we would go and pick at A1, B1.\n",
            "[01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:51,130]  A1, that's not what they wanted.\n",
            "[01:57:51,130 --> 01:57:55,050]  They wanted A1, A2, A3, then B1.\n",
            "[01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:56,730]  Because the way it was produced,\n",
            "[01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:58,740]  the expiries would have been correct.\n",
            "[01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:00,340]  So the expiries were correct,\n",
            "[01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:02,580]  but they also wanted the lots in the right sequence\n",
            "[01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:03,700]  because otherwise the pickers\n",
            "[01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:06,100]  would physically pick it incorrectly.\n",
            "[01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:09,140]  And then they'd have to look in any constant change.\n",
            "[01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:11,700]  So we landed up with quite a...\n",
            "[01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:15,220]  I mean, we landed up with quite a complicated customization.\n",
            "[01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:19,060]  And then they're busy making changes.\n",
            "[01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:22,420]  So if you now have got a lot\n",
            "[01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:24,180]  and now you're busy making changes\n",
            "[01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,700]  in the super picker program,\n",
            "[01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:27,460]  now you're busy changing your sorts again\n",
            "[01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:29,700]  to pick the right quantity.\n",
            "[01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:32,020]  So I don't know how this stuff is working,\n",
            "[01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:34,260]  but it doesn't sound healthy to me.\n",
            "[01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:38,330]  So our last conversation,\n",
            "[01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:42,580]  you've got a meeting tomorrow with Celia?\n",
            "[01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:43,700]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:47,220]  And I said, well, maybe we should have another meeting after that.\n",
            "[01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:49,700]  And then I asked Barry in the meantime\n",
            "[01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,660]  to have a look at changing the sort.\n",
            "[01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:57,930]  So I suggested putting the sort into a subroutine,\n",
            "[01:58:57,930 --> 01:58:59,850]  calling the subroutine a GRV time,\n",
            "[01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:03,130]  and then using it for a fixed program.\n",
            "[01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:04,730]  Then we could fix everything.\n",
            "[01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:06,570]  And then offering that to them at no charge.\n",
            "[01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:09,020]  So they could come back and say,\n",
            "[01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:11,900]  we'll fix all the sorts at no charge\n",
            "[01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:14,220]  as an additional sort.\n",
            "[01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:14,700]  Sort on the knots.\n",
            "[01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,200]  Yeah.\n",
            "[01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:18,700]  But what we need to do is we need to fix the data.\n",
            "[01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:19,980]  And to fix the data,\n",
            "[01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:26,070]  look, if the LRs and LIs are fine,\n",
            "[01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:27,750]  then we should be able to regenerate.\n",
            "[01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:28,710]  If they're not fine,\n",
            "[01:59:28,710 --> 01:59:30,870]  and that wasn't the impression of Barry,\n",
            "[01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:33,110]  then we need to force a balance\n",
            "[01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,030]  and then get them to stock up.\n",
            "[01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:38,810]  Because otherwise, how else are they going to fix it?\n",
            "[01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:42,090]  So if we could offer them something for free,\n",
            "[01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:44,330]  which was viewed as something a lot,\n",
            "[01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:46,010]  then we could possibly say,\n",
            "[01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:47,610]  but we need you to stock up.\n",
            "[01:59:47,610 --> 01:59:51,100]  And we're talking about fast moving stuff.\n",
            "[01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:52,860]  I mean, asking somebody to go and stock up\n",
            "[01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:55,340]  those kind of products is not a small ask.\n",
            "[01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:57,420]  But you stock counting with lots.\n",
            "[01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:00,700]  Just doing an ordinary stock count is a huge ask.\n",
            "[02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:02,860]  But stock counting per lot.\n",
            "[02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:04,860]  They do audit stock counts all the time.\n",
            "[02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:09,740]  So the medicine is counted fairly regularly.\n",
            "[02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:10,860]  They do audit stock counts,\n",
            "[02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:12,860]  because they get told which ones needs to be counted,\n",
            "[02:00:12,860 --> 02:00:17,900]  which batches do you have in your warehouse at this moment.\n",
            "[02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,940]  I kind of thought we could,\n",
            "[02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:21,900]  because when I said to Barry,\n",
            "[02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:22,700]  well, we should fix it,\n",
            "[02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:24,620]  he said, yeah, it's just going to go wrong again.\n",
            "[02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:27,510]  So I lived to that stage.\n",
            "[02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:30,730]  But I think we should fix the sorts\n",
            "[02:00:31,530 --> 02:00:33,210]  and then put a plan together to count.\n",
            "[02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:37,740]  And even if we're just fixing a couple of products at a time,\n",
            "[02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:41,180]  at least we can see, do those products stay okay,\n",
            "[02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:42,140]  or do they also go wrong?\n",
            "[02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,220]  And yes, if they're busy logging out users,\n",
            "[02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:48,060]  then obviously they could have a new data.\n",
            "[02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:50,940]  But if the user's logging out to slow down,\n",
            "[02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:53,980]  now, with what's been put in place,\n",
            "[02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:55,980]  maybe that can't also help at all.\n",
            "[02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:59,350]  Yeah, if they're not logging the users out,\n",
            "[02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:00,790]  the data's not getting corrected,\n",
            "[02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:01,910]  then we just have E.\n",
            "[02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:06,790]  So I think the place that I can see\n",
            "[02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:10,710]  that we might need help is the fixing of this data.\n",
            "[02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:12,630]  When you say the data's getting corrected,\n",
            "[02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:13,750]  which files are?\n",
            "[02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:14,950]  That's why I'm not choosing.\n",
            "[02:01:14,950 --> 02:01:16,230]  My understanding from Barry was\n",
            "[02:01:16,710 --> 02:01:17,990]  it's cooked a little place.\n",
            "[02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:20,230]  Sherman's saying files are not so bad,\n",
            "[02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:21,590]  but the IMs are getting corrected.\n",
            "[02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:22,090]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:25,510]  I'm battling a bit with the different levels of,\n",
            "[02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:28,550]  you're projecting something that is catastrophic.\n",
            "[02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:31,830]  Sherman is taking a far less.\n",
            "[02:01:31,830 --> 02:01:33,350]  I feel more panicky than Sherman.\n",
            "[02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:34,070]  That's the reality.\n",
            "[02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:36,550]  And I feel panicky just listening to it.\n",
            "[02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:39,190]  And I hear what Sherman, what you're saying,\n",
            "[02:01:39,190 --> 02:01:43,050]  in terms of they've tolerated for six months\n",
            "[02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:45,050]  and they've been trading in those six months.\n",
            "[02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:47,050]  So they're frustrated and unhappy,\n",
            "[02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:49,860]  but it's not so bad.\n",
            "[02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:51,780]  But I'm just worried that they're right\n",
            "[02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:54,020]  on the edge of chucking us out.\n",
            "[02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:55,610]  But I don't know.\n",
            "[02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:57,610]  I don't have the relationships, you know.\n",
            "[02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:58,890]  So that's what I'm saying.\n",
            "[02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,730]  I'm saying based on my gut feeling\n",
            "[02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:02,650]  is that I don't think we're at that point\n",
            "[02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:05,050]  where they want to chuck ACS out.\n",
            "[02:02:05,050 --> 02:02:06,810]  I think that they want to find a solution.\n",
            "[02:02:07,610 --> 02:02:10,010]  They want us to, they're working with us\n",
            "[02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:12,170]  to get an answer to this issue.\n",
            "[02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:17,380]  And as long as I have regular meetings with them now,\n",
            "[02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:19,300]  and as long as we're giving them attention\n",
            "[02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:22,580]  and we say, well, this is what we found so far.\n",
            "[02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:23,940]  We're giving you regular feedback.\n",
            "[02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,380]  You tell us what's happening on your side\n",
            "[02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:29,620]  and together we may find the answer.\n",
            "[02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:32,740]  But if something was sent through on Thursday\n",
            "[02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,700]  about 2,000 things that are wrong\n",
            "[02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,860]  and we haven't responded to them yet,\n",
            "[02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:39,060]  I wouldn't feel good.\n",

            "[02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:42,260]  I would have expected we're on it, you know.\n",
            "[02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:44,340]  10 minutes after the email,\n",
            "[02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:46,420]  we're putting a team on.\n",
            "[02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:47,300]  We're going to look at it.\n",
            "[02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:48,500]  We'll get back to you.\n",
            "[02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:50,500]  You know, not like, okay, well,\n",
            "[02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,340]  we were now in a meeting on Monday,\n",
            "[02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:55,740]  so we will only reply on Tuesday.\n",
            "[02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:58,140]  That's going to cause problems.\n",
            "[02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:01,110]  No, no, you're absolutely correct.\n",
            "[02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:03,190]  I need to find out more about that\n",
            "[02:03:03,190 --> 02:03:07,940]  and I will put more emphasis\n",
            "[02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,460]  on the urgency of these things.\n",
            "[02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:11,300]  I'll speak to Barry.\n",
            "[02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:13,660]  And the communication.\n",
            "[02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:14,860]  Because, you know,\n",
            "[02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:16,700]  if you communicate,\n",
            "[02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:21,100]  then that just forgives a lot of sins.\n",
            "[02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,580]  Because it makes them feel,\n",
            "[02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,940]  well, I'm whining and I'm getting a response\n",
            "[02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,380]  and they're doing their best,\n",
            "[02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:30,540]  but I whine and nobody even comes back to me\n",
            "[02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:31,500]  for several days.\n",
            "[02:03:32,410 --> 02:03:33,290]  I don't feel good.\n",
            "[02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:37,770]  And so my dissatisfaction and frustration\n",
            "[02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:39,450]  escalates exponentially.\n",
            "[02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:50,980]  Responses.\n",
            "[02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:52,340]  Barry doing the response to them,\n",
            "[02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:53,140]  are you sure?\n",
            "[02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:55,300]  Barry is dealing with that, I think.\n",

            "[02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:49,980]  because it was like one thing.\n",

            "[02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:58,780]  Then it was the balancing,\n",

            "[02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:36,380]  we'll change the source,\n",
            "[02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:37,660]  we'll change the way we're doing it,\n",

            "[02:05:43,420 --> 02:05:44,860]  and then we'll monitor it from there.\n",

            "[02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:53,350]  And then separately you've got the Lydia,\n",

            "[02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:15,350]  we had a problem here,\n",
            "[02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:15,910]  as you say,\n",
            "[02:06:15,910 --> 02:06:16,630]  Manny fixed it,\n",

            "[02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,760]  Clive came back to say\n",
            "[02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:05,720]  he wants us to do it between 25th of December\n",
            "[02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:09,020]  and 25th of Jan, which is the above.\n",
            "[02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:11,670]  Oh, 25th of Jan is all right.\n",
            "[02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:14,710]  I thought you were going to say 31st of Jan.\n",
            "[02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:17,270]  Yeah, so we're trying to organize a meeting\n",
            "[02:25:17,270 --> 02:25:19,750]  to say can we run it in UAT now?\n",
            "[02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:22,710]  And then prepare that when Keith gets back\n",
            "[02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:24,390]  from the 6th of Jan, then we can do it.\n",
            "[02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:26,470]  That's currently the status for now.\n",
            "[02:25:26,470 --> 02:25:28,070]  If you can dry run it on the...\n",
            "[02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:29,510]  These are much...\n",
            "[02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:33,510]  So there's no current crisis\n",
            "[02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:37,270]  other than the fact there's an enormous upheaval\n",
            "[02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:38,230]  going on in the company.\n",
            "[02:25:40,410 --> 02:25:42,890]  And that always leads to instability and change.\n",
            "[02:25:50,020 --> 02:25:50,980]  Marcel, what was that?\n",
            "[02:25:50,980 --> 02:25:51,780]  V7 again?\n",
            "[02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:52,500]  What was it doing?\n",
            "[02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:53,460]  Its function?\n",
            "[02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:55,860]  They changed the other half of their system.\n",
            "[02:25:55,860 --> 02:25:57,300]  The freight way.\n",
            "[02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:02,020]  I mean, they did their project,\n",
            "[02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:03,380]  but it wasn't just V7.\n",
            "[02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:04,500]  It was all sorts of stuff.\n",
            "[02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:07,780]  There's 20,000 hours worth of custom development\n",
            "[02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:08,420]  that was done.\n",
            "[02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:12,620]  And then there's suspicions\n",
            "[02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:14,300]  that they lost their UAT system\n",
            "[02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:16,300]  and then didn't refresh it properly\n",
            "[02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:18,140]  and they copied it over to Lightman.\n",
            "[02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:22,440]  They basically brought the system to its knees\n",
            "[02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:24,040]  and nearly lost half their customers.\n",
            "[02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:29,120]  Sure.\n",
            "[02:26:31,430 --> 02:26:31,930]  Hardcore.\n",
            "[02:26:32,390 --> 02:26:33,750]  No, it was seriously hardcore.\n",
            "[02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:36,870]  When I say, I think Andre wasn't sleeping\n",
            "[02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:39,190]  like more than four hours a night for a long time.\n",
            "[02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:46,940]  Okay, so for the moment then,\n",
            "[02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:47,740]  value comes off,\n",
            "[02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:50,220]  but we have to get the meetings.\n",
            "[02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:52,460]  I'll stick, I'll leave it there just for the...\n",
            "[02:26:53,020 --> 02:26:54,780]  There's lots of change going on\n",
            "[02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:57,500]  and hopefully by the next meeting\n",
            "[02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:59,960]  we'll have had some kind of visibility.\n",
            "[02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:00,600]  Yeah, okay.\n",
            "[02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:07,980]  I think Hans needs to be on the system.\n",
            "[02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:08,860]  Because if you,\n",
            "[02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:10,300]  you went in the meeting on Thursday.\n",
            "[02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:11,750]  Sorry?\n",
            "[02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:13,350]  You went in this meeting on Thursday.\n",
            "[02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:13,830]  No.\n",
            "[02:27:13,830 --> 02:27:15,110]  If you listen to their tour now,\n",
            "[02:27:15,110 --> 02:27:16,310]  how Jason is talking.\n",
            "[02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:18,580]  He's having lots of problems\n",
            "[02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:20,820]  with our program running slow.\n",
            "[02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:22,580]  Not just the three hour, 40 minutes.\n",
            "[02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:24,660]  And Steve's done changes.\n",
            "[02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:26,980]  We're going to have a lot of testing actually.\n",
            "[02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:28,180]  Hopefully that'll make it better.\n",
            "[02:27:28,820 --> 02:27:30,740]  But there's lots of problems with rental.\n",
            "[02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:32,740]  Since it's not in place.\n",
            "[02:27:33,990 --> 02:27:34,870]  And there's lots of,\n",
            "[02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:35,750]  there's lots of issues.\n",
            "[02:27:36,310 --> 02:27:37,350]  You know, ongoing issues.\n",
            "[02:27:38,660 --> 02:27:40,580]  So all this is just getting bigger and bigger.\n",
            "[02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:42,340]  I think the issues,\n",
            "[02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:44,020]  the other issues outside of rental\n",
            "[02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:45,860]  are not issues they request.\n",
            "[02:27:45,860 --> 02:27:48,900]  They want things to work a different way or...\n",
            "[02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:51,700]  Yeah, but the problem is they're thinking\n",
            "[02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:52,980]  that everything's going to be done.\n",
            "[02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:55,080]  I think.\n",
            "[02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:56,760]  Everything that they're requesting can be done.\n",
            "[02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:58,600]  They shouldn't have to pay.\n",
            "[02:27:58,600 --> 02:27:59,480]  And also now that,\n",
            "[02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:02,580]  they know you've given a lot of customizations\n",
            "[02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:04,260]  towards Verdi and his team.\n",
            "[02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:08,300]  They expect everything to be done like instantly.\n",
            "[02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:08,860]  No, they don't.\n",
            "[02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:12,620]  I explained it to them in the steering meeting\n",
            "[02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:14,460]  and I asked Jason if he agreed\n",
            "[02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:15,740]  and he understood and he said yes.\n",
            "[02:28:16,380 --> 02:28:18,300]  So I don't think that's a solution.\n",
            "[02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:19,820]  But people are sending us\n",
            "[02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:21,180]  when their stuff is going to be done.\n",
            "[02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:21,980]  When it's going to be done.\n",
            "[02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,180]  When it's going to be done.\n",
            "[02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:24,620]  Well, you just have to answer them.\n",
            "[02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:25,340]  And that's what I'm doing.\n",
            "[02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:27,580]  I don't know what the priority is there,\n",
            "[02:28:27,580 --> 02:28:30,140]  but it's gone a lot on its head.\n",
            "[02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:32,780]  They were very over-serviced to an extent,\n",
            "[02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:34,140]  you know, during the go-live\n",
            "[02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:35,500]  because there was so much stuff\n",
            "[02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:39,420]  and you had the whole R&D team reacting very quickly,\n",
            "[02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:41,260]  which does set a precedent.\n",
            "[02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:43,580]  But it's post-go-live now,\n",
            "[02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:46,700]  so things go to normal and they take their time.\n",
            "[02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:50,300]  And I'm sure that's what you explained to Jason.\n",
            "[02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:51,740]  Well, we explained that when...\n",
            "[02:28:54,100 --> 02:28:54,600]  Hmm.\n",
            "[02:28:55,300 --> 02:28:58,950]  He's also not happy that we've handed over\n",
            "[02:28:58,950 --> 02:29:00,710]  because he doesn't feel that they've gone live.\n",
            "[02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:05,190]  Because there's so many issues.\n",
            "[02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:08,470]  I'm not saying it's a valid concern from his,\n",
            "[02:29:08,470 --> 02:29:11,190]  but that is what he's put on the table.\n",
            "[02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:12,230]  Can I just ask, Keith,\n",
            "[02:29:12,230 --> 02:29:14,950]  what are these issues that people are asking you?\n",
            "[02:29:14,950 --> 02:29:17,350]  No, the courts have gone through.\n",
            "[02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:23,380]  So all the stuff that you are approved,\n",
            "[02:29:23,380 --> 02:29:24,100]  that was approved.\n",
            "[02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:26,900]  Is it got anything to do with rain salt?\n",
            "[02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:28,020]  I mean, we didn't worry about it\n",
            "[02:29:28,020 --> 02:29:29,060]  because we discussed it in the meeting.\n",
            "[02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:32,180]  Yeah, he's not going to send it to me anyway.\n",
            "[02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:33,060]  But there's other stuff,\n",
            "[02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:34,500]  now they're waiting for reports from them.\n",
            "[02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:37,000]  But now they're asking for reports on stuff\n",
            "[02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,120]  that's one hour and two hours,\n",
            "[02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:40,440]  so they say they want to take questions on this.\n",
            "[02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:41,880]  And it takes very longer,\n",
            "[02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:43,160]  like about half an hour to do a report.\n",
            "[02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:46,280]  Our standard is three hours.\n",
            "[02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:48,520]  No, that's what I told Cheryl and...\n",
            "[02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:51,860]  If you ask us if under three hours we can do it,\n",
            "[02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:52,900]  if it's under a day,\n",
            "[02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:54,900]  we can confirm by email,\n",
            "[02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:55,940]  and if it's more than that,\n",
            "[02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:57,620]  then we can go on with it.\n",
            "[02:29:57,620 --> 02:29:58,580]  She says she doesn't want to do questions.\n",
            "[02:29:58,580 --> 02:29:59,140]  That's what we tried.\n",
            "[02:29:59,140 --> 02:30:00,500]  Is there no agreement with that?\n",
            "[02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:04,260]  No, normally we put it in when we do an SLA.\n",
            "[02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:05,540]  That's normally what we stick it through.\n",
            "[02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:07,060]  So it's in a support service agreement.\n",
            "[02:30:07,060 --> 02:30:08,980]  He did send me an email last week.\n",
            "[02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:10,900]  I couldn't tell you whether it came through\n",
            "[02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:12,580]  before or after the meeting.\n",
            "[02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:13,940]  I have penned a response,\n",
            "[02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:15,300]  which I haven't sent\n",
            "[02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:19,380]  because I wanted to understand what it was.\n",
            "[02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:22,120]  The one where he says they need more support\n",
            "[02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:28,470]  or just get the same three months or something?\n",
            "[02:30:28,470 --> 02:30:31,030]  Well, basically that he wanted to continue\n",
            "[02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:33,030]  on the same basis for at least another two months.\n",
            "[02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:34,550]  That was the sort of time frame.\n",
            "[02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:35,030]  Yes, that he...\n",
            "[02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:36,390]  That was before the meeting.\n",
            "[02:30:36,390 --> 02:30:37,430]  Was that before the meeting?\n",
            "[02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:37,930]  Yes.\n",
            "[02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:41,030]  So yes, he knew I was away.\n",
            "[02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:43,190]  So I've penned the response,\n",
            "[02:30:43,190 --> 02:30:45,190]  but I would like to just maybe sit with you guys\n",
            "[02:30:45,190 --> 02:30:47,430]  and go through it just so I have some background\n",
            "[02:30:47,430 --> 02:30:49,030]  and let's get a sense of it.\n",
            "[02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:51,430]  So yeah, I think they have been over-serviced\n",
            "[02:30:51,430 --> 02:30:53,030]  and I think there is an expectation.\n",
            "[02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:57,180]  And yes, he said for a long time\n",
            "[02:30:57,180 --> 02:30:58,620]  about this sort of...\n",
            "[02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:00,540]  He doesn't think that they should be moving\n",
            "[02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:04,060]  from the go-live support that they were having\n",
            "[02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:05,180]  to the support services.\n",
            "[02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:08,890]  They have been resisting that change.\n",
            "[02:31:08,890 --> 02:31:11,930]  And so I don't believe that it's...\n",
            "[02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:14,870]  I understand what he's saying,\n",
            "[02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:16,950]  but I don't believe his approach is correct.\n",
            "[02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:19,030]  And he has agreed in principle\n",
            "[02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:20,550]  to sign the support agreement.\n",
            "[02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:22,390]  That's what he said to me on the telephone.\n",
            "[02:31:22,390 --> 02:31:23,590]  It just hasn't come through yet.\n",
            "[02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:26,310]  So it vacillates, but that's...\n",
            "[02:31:26,310 --> 02:31:27,830]  I'm happy to speak to him,\n",
            "[02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:30,550]  but I just need to get a sense of what went down.\n",
            "[02:31:30,550 --> 02:31:31,050]  And then...\n",
            "[02:31:32,020 --> 02:31:34,340]  So I hear where you're coming from.\n",
            "[02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:38,090]  I'm not sure whether it's at that point,\n",
            "[02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:43,290]  but yes, I think they are becoming more testy.\n",
            "[02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:45,610]  So there were three issues\n",
            "[02:31:45,610 --> 02:31:47,770]  that he was testy about in my opinion.\n",
            "[02:31:48,330 --> 02:31:50,070]  On Thursday, the one was...\n",
            "[02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:56,010]  The one was the response time,\n",
            "[02:31:56,570 --> 02:31:58,870]  the processing of the jobs.\n",
            "[02:31:58,870 --> 02:32:02,390]  And he said their productivity's gone for a ball of shit.\n",
            "[02:32:02,390 --> 02:32:03,190]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:04,230]  He says even the small ones.\n",
            "[02:32:04,230 --> 02:32:05,350]  Literally, that's what he said.\n",
            "[02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:06,470]  Even the small ones.\n",
            "[02:32:06,470 --> 02:32:07,510]  10 minutes is too long.\n",
            "[02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:09,260]  Five, 10 minutes is long.\n",
            "[02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:12,940]  So I had a look at the data.\n",
            "[02:32:12,940 --> 02:32:15,980]  And I mean, that one that took three and a half hours,\n",
            "[02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:18,300]  actually, they've got a very nice machine\n",
            "[02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:19,820]  that it took three and a half hours\n",
            "[02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:21,980]  because single user on ACSA\n",
            "[02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:24,220]  took me five and a half hours for the same job.\n",
            "[02:32:24,860 --> 02:32:25,360]  So...\n",
            "[02:32:26,860 --> 02:32:27,360]  Lines.\n",
            "[02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:31,340]  Yes, 64 sales order lines.\n",
            "[02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:33,820]  So it gets exponentially slower.\n",
            "[02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:37,530]  But the next longest job\n",
            "[02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:42,280]  was 23 sales order lines in their data.\n",
            "[02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:43,400]  So it's not like...\n",
            "[02:32:43,400 --> 02:32:45,080]  And there's only a couple of those.\n",
            "[02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:48,520]  So it's not like this is an everyday occurrence.\n",
            "[02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:51,000]  So I'm just putting that in perspective.\n",
            "[02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,830]  But in terms of responsiveness,\n",
            "[02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:57,270]  I've worked on nothing since that log was sent to me.\n",
            "[02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:57,770]  Okay?\n",
            "[02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:00,070]  That's all I've been doing.\n",
            "[02:33:00,070 --> 02:33:01,590]  And Dean has been working...\n",
            "[02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:03,510]  Pretty much the same.\n",
            "[02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:04,470]  Pretty much the same.\n",
            "[02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:07,510]  He's been working on the array handling.\n",
            "[02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:10,230]  And I've been working on the logic flow.\n",
            "[02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:13,430]  So we've been doing our own thing\n",
            "[02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:14,630]  and just sharing notes,\n",
            "[02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:18,150]  saying what successes and failures we've been having.\n",
            "[02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:22,310]  So we have got it to a point now\n",
            "[02:33:22,310 --> 02:33:25,910]  where that job that took on ACSA five and a half hours\n",
            "[02:33:26,470 --> 02:33:30,630]  is currently taking two minutes and 45 seconds.\n",
            "[02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:31,510]  That's awesome.\n",
            "[02:33:31,510 --> 02:33:33,350]  So that's a huge difference.\n",
            "[02:33:34,150 --> 02:33:36,470]  The changes Dean's done,\n",
            "[02:33:36,470 --> 02:33:40,070]  which I've just put into the test area\n",
            "[02:33:40,070 --> 02:33:40,570]  just to...\n",
            "[02:33:41,430 --> 02:33:43,110]  On the array handling.\n",
            "[02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:44,230]  So that job,\n",
            "[02:33:44,230 --> 02:33:47,910]  when you call that job up now to work on it,\n",
            "[02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:50,470]  was taking between five and seven minutes,\n",
            "[02:33:51,190 --> 02:33:52,310]  hour-lasting,\n",
            "[02:33:52,310 --> 02:33:55,030]  just to load up to show you the headers.\n",
            "[02:33:55,030 --> 02:33:56,070]  When you drill on,\n",
            "[02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:59,270]  another two to three minutes to open the fault.\n",
            "[02:33:59,990 --> 02:34:04,260]  So very hard for me even to work through it,\n",
            "[02:34:04,980 --> 02:34:06,100]  testing my data,\n",
            "[02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:10,180]  because it's very hard to work with that volume of data.\n",
            "[02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:13,300]  So Dean's changes have made that\n",
            "[02:34:13,300 --> 02:34:15,860]  to like two seconds to load the job.\n",
            "[02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:17,320]  I mean,\n",
            "[02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:21,060]  from five to seven minutes improvement,\n",
            "[02:34:21,060 --> 02:34:21,620]  but I mean,\n",
            "[02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:22,340]  if there's...\n",
            "[02:34:22,340 --> 02:34:23,780]  Well, he's not loading everything,\n",
            "[02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:24,280]  but it looks...\n",
            "[02:34:27,850 --> 02:34:28,490]  How many hours,\n",
            "[02:34:28,490 --> 02:34:29,770]  three and a half hours is now,\n",
            "[02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:31,050]  how many hours is it?\n",
            "[02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:33,370]  Well, yeah, he's just said five hours to two minutes.\n",
            "[02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:35,370]  Five hours to two minutes.\n",
            "[02:34:35,370 --> 02:34:36,010]  Two minutes.\n",
            "[02:34:36,570 --> 02:34:37,210]  That's good.\n",
            "[02:34:37,210 --> 02:34:38,810]  That would be awesome.\n",
            "[02:34:38,810 --> 02:34:40,650]  Five and a half hours to two minutes.\n",
            "[02:34:40,650 --> 02:34:41,930]  Seven minutes to two seconds.\n",
            "[02:34:41,930 --> 02:34:46,090]  I mean, two minutes to do a 63 fault.\n",
            "[02:34:46,330 --> 02:34:46,830]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:34:48,330 --> 02:34:50,140]  So look,\n",
            "[02:34:50,940 --> 02:34:53,340]  this has got to be thoroughly tested.\n",
            "[02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:57,260]  And so there's a lot of work ahead.\n",
            "[02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:59,340]  But what I'm trying to say to you, Keith,\n",
            "[02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:03,130]  is we understand the importance.\n",
            "[02:35:03,130 --> 02:35:07,450]  And when there's a serious log,\n",
            "[02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:08,890]  we do treat it seriously.\n",
            "[02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:10,810]  And we do drop everything else.\n",
            "[02:35:10,810 --> 02:35:15,210]  And so that is a kind of response.\n",
            "[02:35:15,770 --> 02:35:17,290]  It's too good a response,\n",
            "[02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:19,290]  because based on the last time,\n",
            "[02:35:20,650 --> 02:35:22,250]  that was how long to take\n",
            "[02:35:22,250 --> 02:35:24,570]  to fix the first performance upgrade\n",
            "[02:35:24,570 --> 02:35:25,930]  during the Go Live month.\n",
            "[02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:29,740]  That was about a week.\n",
            "[02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:30,240]  And that was...\n",
            "[02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:33,340]  The problem is the expectation.\n",
            "[02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:38,540]  I would say the expectation should be about a month,\n",
            "[02:35:39,100 --> 02:35:43,020]  given that this is our only focus on this kind of issue,\n",
            "[02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:44,620]  because we've already taken a stab at it.\n",
            "[02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:47,990]  And we got where we got.\n",
            "[02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:49,270]  Now, to further improve it,\n",
            "[02:35:50,390 --> 02:35:53,590]  the expectation is definitely not a week or a day.\n",
            "[02:35:53,590 --> 02:35:54,790]  Well, it sounds like it's going to be a month.\n",
            "[02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:59,100]  Gene, I think it's your system is...\n",
            "[02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:01,560]  I understand where you're coming from,\n",
            "[02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:02,440]  in terms of performance.\n",
            "[02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:04,040]  But from their perspective,\n",
            "[02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:07,320]  is this system workable or not workable?\n",
            "[02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:09,640]  I'm just comparing this to Geke.\n",
            "[02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:14,600]  You know, if you put Jason and Geke in the same room,\n",
            "[02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:15,800]  you know, six months,\n",
            "[02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:21,590]  and like virtually a huge, huge compromise\n",
            "[02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:24,230]  to their business and the ability to trade.\n",
            "[02:36:24,230 --> 02:36:25,270]  And this is the problem,\n",
            "[02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:30,230]  that one of our focus has been on almost for the last year.\n",
            "[02:36:30,230 --> 02:36:34,950]  And that has had an impact on the rest of the customers.\n",
            "[02:36:34,950 --> 02:36:40,630]  So even now, when things come through to R&D,\n",
            "[02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:41,670]  it's like, are we busy?\n",
            "[02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:45,430]  You know, and now the fact that Keith\n",
            "[02:36:45,430 --> 02:36:48,550]  has taken over ORMS is an issue,\n",
            "[02:36:48,550 --> 02:36:51,510]  because it's not taken additional focus.\n",
            "[02:36:51,510 --> 02:36:52,550]  While he absorbs it,\n",
            "[02:36:52,550 --> 02:36:54,390]  even with Chantal's help,\n",
            "[02:36:54,390 --> 02:36:57,030]  when Ruth is busy looking for assistance\n",
            "[02:36:57,030 --> 02:36:58,950]  and needs somebody to test it and hasn't got,\n",
            "[02:36:58,950 --> 02:37:00,150]  and she looks around,\n",
            "[02:37:00,150 --> 02:37:01,910]  and there's nobody there to do it,\n",
            "[02:37:01,910 --> 02:37:03,990]  you know, because everybody's busy.\n",
            "[02:37:04,710 --> 02:37:07,030]  And so she's also sweating.\n",
            "[02:37:07,850 --> 02:37:12,090]  Really, ORMS has been a huge impact.\n",
            "[02:37:12,090 --> 02:37:12,810]  It's been a huge impact.\n",
            "[02:37:12,810 --> 02:37:14,490]  But I wouldn't have thought to support,\n",
            "[02:37:14,490 --> 02:37:17,530]  because basically R&D did all the customizations.\n",
            "[02:37:17,530 --> 02:37:19,610]  But people that were previously available,\n",
            "[02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:21,770]  so you talk to Donna, can you help, now I'm busy.\n",
            "[02:37:22,490 --> 02:37:24,730]  You know, you talk to people, now they're busy.\n",
            "[02:37:24,730 --> 02:37:27,050]  And so then people have to make other plans,\n",
            "[02:37:27,050 --> 02:37:28,410]  and they've got to do it themselves.\n",
            "[02:37:29,130 --> 02:37:31,530]  So people are sweating.\n",
            "[02:37:31,530 --> 02:37:32,410]  That's what's going on.\n",
            "[02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:36,140]  And it was never fed to you, Dee?\n",
            "[02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:37,100]  Well, we haven't had meetings\n",
            "[02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:38,540]  for a long time to discuss it,\n",
            "[02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:40,300]  but there hasn't really been a forum.\n",
            "[02:37:40,300 --> 02:37:41,900]  But this is what's going on.\n",
            "[02:37:43,430 --> 02:37:46,230]  We know that we're under pressure.\n",
            "[02:37:46,230 --> 02:37:48,470]  No, we know we're busy with ORMS,\n",
            "[02:37:48,470 --> 02:37:50,310]  but we weren't informed\n",
            "[02:37:50,310 --> 02:37:53,110]  that other people were suffering because of it.\n",
            "[02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:53,910]  Ah, yeah.\n",
            "[02:37:54,470 --> 02:37:55,670]  I mean, there was that one issue.\n",
            "[02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:56,550]  I'm sure that's the one\n",
            "[02:37:57,270 --> 02:38:01,750]  where Lydia escalated all the way up to you,\n",
            "[02:38:01,750 --> 02:38:05,000]  and then we junked it in the end.\n",
            "[02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:05,560]  Well, we didn't.\n",
            "[02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:08,200]  We somewhat compromised,\n",
            "[02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:11,460]  but, you know, she didn't get,\n",
            "[02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:12,580]  she didn't feel like she was getting\n",
            "[02:38:13,140 --> 02:38:15,140]  the response she needed from the other guys,\n",
            "[02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:16,260]  and she didn't believe them.\n",
            "[02:38:16,260 --> 02:38:20,180]  And so, but because we did that,\n",
            "[02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:24,630]  then we fell behind on, you know,\n",
            "[02:38:24,630 --> 02:38:26,470]  important stuff came out of ORMS,\n",
            "[02:38:26,470 --> 02:38:28,230]  and we were...\n",
            "[02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:29,510]  That's my point, Dee.\n",
            "[02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:29,830]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:38:29,830 --> 02:38:30,870]  You understand my point?\n",
            "[02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:32,390]  I do understand your point.\n",
            "[02:38:32,390 --> 02:38:33,990]  Lydia can even be wrong.\n",
            "[02:38:33,990 --> 02:38:34,470]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:38:34,470 --> 02:38:35,990]  So she might believe something.\n",
            "[02:38:35,990 --> 02:38:36,230]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:38,630]  And she might need help to prove that she is wrong,\n",
            "[02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:40,870]  and then now go look for something else.\n",
            "[02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:43,590]  And the fact that at the end of it,\n",
            "[02:38:43,590 --> 02:38:44,790]  she's wasted your time\n",
            "[02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:46,790]  because it turned out to be wrong,\n",
            "[02:38:47,350 --> 02:38:49,110]  doesn't mean that she didn't need that help\n",
            "[02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:51,510]  to go down that hole to see what there was.\n",
            "[02:38:51,510 --> 02:38:51,670]  No, for sure.\n",
            "[02:38:51,670 --> 02:38:53,270]  To see what there was.\n",
            "[02:38:53,270 --> 02:38:57,830]  And if I look at the email that came out\n",
            "[02:38:57,830 --> 02:38:59,110]  while I was on leave, which was,\n",
            "[02:38:59,910 --> 02:39:02,470]  okay, don't log it unless you know what you're doing,\n",
            "[02:39:02,470 --> 02:39:03,670]  and if you don't know what you're doing,\n",
            "[02:39:03,670 --> 02:39:04,630]  send it to Keith.\n",
            "[02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:05,750]  And Keith is now busy.\n",
            "[02:39:06,070 --> 02:39:07,030]  Mm-hmm.\n",
            "[02:39:07,030 --> 02:39:08,710]  And so you've got to...\n",
            "[02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:11,030]  I'm telling you now, you've got people like Ruth,\n",
            "[02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:13,190]  and they have got issues, and they need help,\n",
            "[02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:15,110]  and they need somebody to test.\n",
            "[02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:17,190]  They need somebody to test it to prove\n",
            "[02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:20,630]  that 13 and 15 are different, okay?\n",
            "[02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:21,510]  And who can they do it?\n",
            "[02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:22,550]  And it's not complicated\n",
            "[02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:23,990]  because you're not going to set up data,\n",
            "[02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:25,510]  and you've got to put in four different things\n",
            "[02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:26,950]  and do them like this and that.\n",
            "[02:39:26,950 --> 02:39:28,150]  And quite honestly,\n",
            "[02:39:28,150 --> 02:39:29,990]  even trying to get somebody else to do it is difficult.\n",
            "[02:39:29,990 --> 02:39:31,350]  I must have a store assistant.\n",
            "[02:39:31,350 --> 02:39:31,670]  It's not...\n",
            "[02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:33,270]  She sends it.\n",
            "[02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:34,230]  She wants it done straight away.\n",
            "[02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:34,630]  Yeah, sure, sure.\n",
            "[02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:35,670]  Then she'll send it to me,\n",
            "[02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:36,390]  she'll send it to Barry,\n",
            "[02:39:36,390 --> 02:39:37,030]  she'll send it to someone else.\n",
            "[02:39:37,030 --> 02:39:37,750]  Sure, she does.\n",
            "[02:39:37,750 --> 02:39:38,710]  And I tell her,\n",
            "[02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:40,630]  I will get you because you're busy on other things.\n",
            "[02:39:40,630 --> 02:39:42,070]  Yes, because you're busy with other things.\n",
            "[02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:43,270]  But I told her,\n",
            "[02:39:43,270 --> 02:39:44,550]  and normally I get to it\n",
            "[02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:45,830]  by the afternoon, the next day.\n",
            "[02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:46,950]  It's not just the customers\n",
            "[02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:48,550]  that are expecting to be over-serviced.\n",
            "[02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:49,270]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:52,230]  No, no, no, no, no.\n",
            "[02:39:52,230 --> 02:39:54,790]  So yeah, we are under a lot of...\n",
            "[02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:55,590]  I'm talking about...\n",
            "[02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:57,190]  Because the way it all starts to work,\n",
            "[02:39:57,190 --> 02:39:58,070]  but I start to plant it\n",
            "[02:39:58,070 --> 02:39:58,950]  and send it to work to Barry,\n",
            "[02:39:58,950 --> 02:39:59,830]  but there's two businesses,\n",
            "[02:39:59,830 --> 02:40:00,790]  so I'm doing all the work.\n",
            "[02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:02,470]  So that's...\n",
            "[02:40:02,470 --> 02:40:03,910]  Yeah, so it's backing up into you now.\n",
            "[02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:05,510]  So now I'm doing the work, yeah.\n",
            "[02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:08,980]  People are getting grumpy.\n",
            "[02:40:08,980 --> 02:40:10,420]  And I haven't said anything to Barry.\n",
            "[02:40:10,420 --> 02:40:12,100]  I haven't said anything to him at all today,\n",
            "[02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:13,300]  because I know he's busy.\n",
            "[02:40:13,300 --> 02:40:14,180]  The only thing I've said to him\n",
            "[02:40:14,180 --> 02:40:16,740]  is custom development work that they need to do,\n",
            "[02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:18,500]  to give the port and do that work,\n",
            "[02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:20,660]  when they give the go-ahead.\n",
            "[02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:23,880]  And that's all the queries and whatever we have.\n",
            "[02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:28,620]  So Sian, you said that there were three issues\n",
            "[02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:30,300]  and we got one,\n",
            "[02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:31,820]  which was the response time.\n",
            "[02:40:31,820 --> 02:40:33,100]  What's two?\n",
            "[02:40:33,100 --> 02:40:36,460]  Number two was the fact that they agreed\n",
            "[02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:38,780]  to all of these customizations\n",
            "[02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:41,500]  and for the rental module,\n",
            "[02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:43,580]  and they're not seeing them.\n",
            "[02:40:43,580 --> 02:40:48,840]  And I explained to Jason,\n",
            "[02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:50,440]  and I have explained to Jensen\n",
            "[02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:52,040]  and he had agreed with me,\n",
            "[02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:53,320]  that we are not...\n",
            "[02:40:53,320 --> 02:40:55,480]  The customizations are happening,\n",
            "[02:40:55,480 --> 02:40:57,640]  but we are not putting another piece\n",
            "[02:40:57,640 --> 02:41:00,230]  of software on that site\n",
            "[02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:02,710]  until we've stabilized the availability.\n",
            "[02:41:02,710 --> 02:41:06,760]  Because if you don't have accurate availability,\n",
            "[02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:07,560]  you've got nothing.\n",
            "[02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:10,120]  And at the moment,\n",
            "[02:41:11,450 --> 02:41:13,370]  we've got availability issues\n",
            "[02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:15,930]  that are coming through every single day.\n",
            "[02:41:15,930 --> 02:41:20,380]  And we found some that are related to the system\n",
            "[02:41:20,380 --> 02:41:22,300]  and William and Angela\n",
            "[02:41:22,300 --> 02:41:24,060]  have sorted those ones out.\n",
            "[02:41:24,620 --> 02:41:29,180]  And we found some that are related to setup\n",
            "[02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:31,500]  that Jensen has done recently,\n",
            "[02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:32,620]  that's not correct.\n",
            "[02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:35,860]  And so we've sent him reports\n",
            "[02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:37,460]  to check his setup.\n",
            "[02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:38,900]  And I don't think he's doing it.\n",
            "[02:41:40,310 --> 02:41:41,910]  But I said to them,\n",
            "[02:41:41,910 --> 02:41:42,470]  we are not...\n",
            "[02:41:42,470 --> 02:41:43,990]  And I said,\n",
            "[02:41:43,990 --> 02:41:45,670]  you know, we've got custom development,\n",
            "[02:41:45,670 --> 02:41:46,630]  we've got standard,\n",
            "[02:41:47,590 --> 02:41:48,950]  changes in standard package\n",
            "[02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:50,470]  and everybody says,\n",
            "[02:41:50,470 --> 02:41:51,350]  you know, like,\n",
            "[02:41:51,350 --> 02:41:53,350]  it's not this, it's not this, it's not this.\n",
            "[02:41:53,910 --> 02:41:55,830]  I'm not putting another piece of software\n",
            "[02:41:55,830 --> 02:41:56,470]  on that site\n",
            "[02:41:56,470 --> 02:41:58,550]  that affects the availability calculation.\n",
            "[02:41:59,270 --> 02:42:00,070]  And he said,\n",

            "[02:42:02,710 --> 02:42:07,980]  Third thing that he brought up\n",
            "[02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:10,840]  was the email thing.\n",
            "[02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:15,060]  This email thing has been going for months now.\n",
            "[02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:17,460]  And first we said that we didn't,\n",
            "[02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:19,140]  the problem was not on our side.\n",
            "[02:42:19,140 --> 02:42:19,620]  And then...\n",
            "[02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:21,380]  This is the SMTP server.\n",
            "[02:42:21,380 --> 02:42:22,420]  No, not the SMTP server.\n",
            "[02:42:22,420 --> 02:42:23,540]  Yeah, the SMTP server.\n",
            "[02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:24,580]  Before it was...\n",
            "[02:42:24,580 --> 02:42:26,340]  Before we had the SMTP server\n",
            "[02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:27,460]  when they were using...\n",
            "[02:42:27,460 --> 02:42:28,020]  Office 365.\n",
            "[02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:29,700]  Office 365, they had a limit.\n",
            "[02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:30,660]  So that was on their side.\n",
            "[02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:31,620]  They had that limit.\n",
            "[02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:33,220]  We said it wasn't on our side\n",
            "[02:42:33,220 --> 02:42:35,140]  and they said it wasn't on their side.\n",
            "[02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:37,860]  And then they proved that it was on our side.\n",
            "[02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:40,660]  No, we proved that it was on their side.\n",
            "[02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:41,140]  Both ways.\n",
            "[02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:42,100]  Yeah, both ways.\n",
            "[02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:42,660]  Both ways.\n",
            "[02:42:43,460 --> 02:42:45,960]  And, but I just don't,\n",
            "[02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:48,280]  I think my experience is\n",
            "[02:42:48,280 --> 02:42:49,560]  we walk into these meetings\n",
            "[02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,760]  and we just start denying.\n",
            "[02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:51,480]  It's not our problem.\n",
            "[02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:52,360]  It's not our problem.\n",
            "[02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:55,140]  And the more they're trying to explain to you\n",
            "[02:42:55,140 --> 02:42:56,180]  what they're experiencing,\n",
            "[02:42:56,180 --> 02:42:57,140]  the more you're telling them\n",
            "[02:42:57,140 --> 02:42:58,020]  it's not on our side.\n",
            "[02:42:58,020 --> 02:42:58,980]  No, I never told them that.\n",
            "[02:42:58,980 --> 02:42:59,860]  If you look at my mails,\n",
            "[02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:01,540]  I don't say anything's not on our side.\n",
            "[02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:03,620]  I said we investigate and we've got the people.\n",
            "[02:43:03,620 --> 02:43:05,060]  But it's a process to go through.\n",
            "[02:43:05,620 --> 02:43:06,580]  That's what I tell them.\n",
            "[02:43:06,580 --> 02:43:07,940]  Because he's been copied on the mail\n",
            "[02:43:07,940 --> 02:43:09,860]  but Vaughan calls him and says\n",
            "[02:43:09,860 --> 02:43:11,860]  he's spending lots of time.\n",
            "[02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:13,700]  But we're also spending the same amount of time.\n",
            "[02:43:13,700 --> 02:43:14,580]  I'm spending time.\n",
            "[02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:15,780]  Even through his business.\n",
            "[02:43:15,780 --> 02:43:16,420]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:43:16,420 --> 02:43:19,300]  But the thing is that they moved on\n",
            "[02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:20,260]  to a different server\n",
            "[02:43:20,260 --> 02:43:21,620]  and then they had other issues.\n",
            "[02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:23,700]  And now I think, you know,\n",
            "[02:43:23,700 --> 02:43:24,820]  like whatever you say,\n",
            "[02:43:24,820 --> 02:43:26,500]  he just says I don't believe you.\n",
            "[02:43:26,500 --> 02:43:27,140]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:43:27,140 --> 02:43:28,980]  Because now he goes up to the SMT\n",
            "[02:43:28,980 --> 02:43:31,540]  because Vaughan is saying it's our fault.\n",
            "[02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:32,340]  Straight up.\n",
            "[02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:33,700]  Vaughan says no, it's not on his side.\n",
            "[02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:34,340]  And he doesn't.\n",
            "[02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:36,100]  So that's why we are trying to prove\n",
            "[02:43:36,740 --> 02:43:38,500]  to see whether it's our side or not.\n",
            "[02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:39,780]  And we're going through the process.\n",
            "[02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:42,340]  It's not an easy thing to find.\n",
            "[02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:43,700]  Because it's dropping the connection.\n",
            "[02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:44,900]  But then let's say, you know,\n",
            "[02:43:44,900 --> 02:43:46,820]  we're not sure we're still investigating.\n",
            "[02:43:46,820 --> 02:43:48,100]  That's on my emails.\n",
            "[02:43:48,100 --> 02:43:50,020]  But every time we have a meeting,\n",
            "[02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:51,460]  we say it's this.\n",
            "[02:43:51,460 --> 02:43:53,460]  Last week, this meeting,\n",
            "[02:43:53,460 --> 02:43:54,260]  we said it was...\n",
            "[02:43:55,860 --> 02:43:57,700]  We found something besides the body.\n",
            "[02:43:57,700 --> 02:43:59,060]  Those get refused.\n",
            "[02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:01,220]  And he's saying it's not that.\n",
            "[02:44:01,220 --> 02:44:02,020]  I don't believe you.\n",
            "[02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:05,590]  So now whatever Keith says,\n",
            "[02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:06,550]  he's just got a wall.\n",
            "[02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:07,990]  And he says, I don't believe you.\n",
            "[02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:09,270]  I think you need to look at this.\n",
            "[02:44:09,270 --> 02:44:10,310]  I think you need to look at this.\n",
            "[02:44:10,310 --> 02:44:12,150]  I've had that impression as well.\n",
            "[02:44:12,150 --> 02:44:13,430]  When you guys say no,\n",
            "[02:44:13,430 --> 02:44:14,550]  it's the SMTP server.\n",
            "[02:44:14,550 --> 02:44:17,350]  And I'm like, I'm not sure of that.\n",
            "[02:44:17,350 --> 02:44:17,990]  Talking to you.\n",
            "[02:44:17,990 --> 02:44:19,350]  I wouldn't say that to them.\n",
            "[02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:20,710]  No, I don't tell them that.\n",
            "[02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:21,270]  I've never told them that.\n",
            "[02:44:21,270 --> 02:44:24,390]  But it sounds like that's what's been said.\n",
            "[02:44:24,390 --> 02:44:24,710]  Because...\n",
            "[02:44:25,510 --> 02:44:26,790]  No, but in the meetings...\n",
            "[02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:28,310]  And I know that that's our belief.\n",
            "[02:44:28,310 --> 02:44:29,270]  But we have to prove it\n",
            "[02:44:29,270 --> 02:44:30,230]  without a shadow of a doubt.\n",
            "[02:44:30,230 --> 02:44:32,390]  That's why I always say we're looking at it.\n",
            "[02:44:32,390 --> 02:44:33,270]  If you look at my emails,\n",
            "[02:44:33,270 --> 02:44:34,710]  he has copied it on all the emails.\n",
            "[02:44:34,710 --> 02:44:36,470]  And they've been investigating as well.\n",
            "[02:44:36,950 --> 02:44:37,910]  It's their fault.\n",
            "[02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:39,110]  I say, okay, we're looking at this.\n",
            "[02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:40,790]  But he says, make these changes.\n",
            "[02:44:40,790 --> 02:44:41,750]  We make the changes.\n",
            "[02:44:41,750 --> 02:44:42,470]  We test.\n",
            "[02:44:42,470 --> 02:44:43,190]  We go back.\n",
            "[02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:43,990]  We're testing.\n",
            "[02:44:43,990 --> 02:44:46,470]  We've got informatics doing a whole lot of tests.\n",
            "[02:44:46,470 --> 02:44:47,670]  We even did the test about\n",
            "[02:44:48,230 --> 02:44:50,550]  sending the emails to our SMTP server\n",
            "[02:44:50,550 --> 02:44:51,830]  and to the SMTP server.\n",
            "[02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:53,830]  Those things don't drop.\n",
            "[02:44:56,380 --> 02:44:56,860]  We are...\n",
            "[02:44:56,860 --> 02:44:59,020]  I've been through it scientifically.\n",
            "[02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:02,060]  This is the information I need\n",
            "[02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:04,540]  to analyze it scientifically.\n",
            "[02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:06,860]  So until you give me that,\n",
            "[02:45:06,860 --> 02:45:07,900]  I can't...\n",
            "[02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:10,140]  So yeah, so we checked everything.\n",
            "[02:45:10,140 --> 02:45:11,580]  The only thing that we found now\n",
            "[02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:14,970]  on the email situation is\n",
            "[02:45:14,970 --> 02:45:16,810]  the connection is waiting for an input\n",
            "[02:45:16,810 --> 02:45:17,930]  and the connection gets dropped.\n",
            "[02:45:18,730 --> 02:45:20,250]  We increased the time limits.\n",
            "[02:45:20,250 --> 02:45:20,890]  Did everything.\n",
            "[02:45:22,460 --> 02:45:24,620]  Then Claude found out on the SMTP server\n",
            "[02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:26,940]  the body, number of characters in the body.\n",
            "[02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:29,500]  It can't be more than 900 characters.\n",
            "[02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:30,940]  So because we...\n",
            "[02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:33,100]  And that's the only difference from all our other sites.\n",
            "[02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:34,140]  Well, it's customers.\n",
            "[02:45:34,140 --> 02:45:35,500]  That's what he inspected.\n",
            "[02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:38,540]  So because we do the image and whatever,\n",
            "[02:45:38,540 --> 02:45:41,980]  that body is close to 3,000, 4,000.\n",
            "[02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:43,660]  Some of them are 8,000 characters.\n",
            "[02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:48,200]  And on their side, they see that it drops.\n",
            "[02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:49,960]  But when you reprocess, it goes through.\n",
            "[02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:51,800]  So I checked that.\n",
            "[02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:53,640]  But yeah, the funny thing...\n",
            "[02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,960]  So I looked at the body, the total body\n",
            "[02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:57,080]  and looked at the size.\n",
            "[02:45:57,080 --> 02:45:59,880]  I put it into Notepad++, look at the size.\n",
            "[02:46:00,440 --> 02:46:00,940]  And then...\n",
            "[02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:03,740]  So I looked at it in the fail.\n",
            "[02:46:03,740 --> 02:46:05,260]  Then we take that same one\n",
            "[02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:07,740]  and we resend it\n",
            "[02:46:07,740 --> 02:46:08,860]  and it goes through.\n",
            "[02:46:08,860 --> 02:46:10,460]  And then I look at the...\n",
            "[02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:13,340]  And it's character for character, identical.\n",
            "[02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:17,340]  And so why does the SMTP server\n",
            "[02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:19,660]  sometimes fuss and not other times?\n",
            "[02:46:20,300 --> 02:46:21,820]  So that's the question.\n",
            "[02:46:21,820 --> 02:46:23,820]  That's the million-dollar question.\n",
            "[02:46:23,820 --> 02:46:26,460]  It fails when it's interactive.\n",
            "[02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:29,900]  We take it with the same email message.\n",
            "[02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:32,460]  It's a complete message.\n",
            "[02:46:32,460 --> 02:46:34,700]  We just say, send it again to the SMTP.\n",
            "[02:46:34,700 --> 02:46:36,140]  The identical data.\n",

            "[02:50:18,860 --> 02:50:20,380]  I mean, when you send Vaughan an email\n",

            "[02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:24,460]  he does, goes and does his diagnostic.\n",

            "[02:50:25,580 --> 02:50:26,700]  And he comes back and he says,\n",
            "[02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:29,100]  no, it's not this because of X, Y and Z.\n",

            "[02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:30,240]  So...\n",
            "[02:50:30,860 --> 02:50:33,100]  And if we have access to his SMTP server\n",
            "[02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:34,060]  then we can go into it.\n",
            "[02:50:34,060 --> 02:50:35,660]  But he won't trust that.\n",
            "[02:50:36,380 --> 02:50:39,020]  But these emails have failed.\n",
            "[02:50:39,020 --> 02:50:40,940]  So that report comes from him.\n",

            "[02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:47,260]  But we can show that it's sending that fail message.\n",

            "[02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:50,140]  But in the same email it doesn't send the message.\n",

            "[02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:52,540]  We've told him that.\n",
            "[02:50:52,540 --> 02:50:53,820]  But it's our fault.\n",
            "[02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:54,320]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:50:56,330 --> 02:50:58,170]  So we have to prove it beyond the reason.\n",
            "[02:50:59,320 --> 02:51:00,680]  That it's difficult.\n",
            "[02:51:01,580 --> 02:51:03,820]  You need his authority to make a difference.\n",
            "[02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:04,700]  So my plan...\n",
            "[02:51:04,700 --> 02:51:05,820]  And every time you ask for his help...\n",
            "[02:51:06,700 --> 02:51:08,940]  But my plan for them, Steve, was...\n",
            "[02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:10,300]  Now that we've done all this stuff,\n",
            "[02:51:10,300 --> 02:51:12,540]  I want to put it on our mail side.\n",
            "[02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:13,420]  You know like how we did...\n",
            "[02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:14,540]  Paleon got me to do the same thing\n",
            "[02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:15,500]  and then we proved that it was there.\n",
            "[02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:16,780]  I never get excited about that.\n",
            "[02:51:16,780 --> 02:51:19,580]  Just for two, three days to see.\n",
            "[02:51:19,580 --> 02:51:23,020]  No, because if we can end up being blacklisted...\n",
            "[02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:23,520]  Yes, no.\n",
            "[02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:26,060]  I know it's difficult.\n",
            "[02:51:26,060 --> 02:51:27,580]  But that's what we did for Paleon\n",

            "[02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:26,480]  And the printing is done.\n",

            "[02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:31,450]  Is that printing the PDF?\n",
            "[02:53:32,250 --> 02:53:34,330]  No, it takes long for the prints to come out.\n",
            "[02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:36,400]  But when you talk...\n",
            "[02:53:36,400 --> 02:53:37,600]  But it's not consistent.\n",

            "[02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:42,810]  So for them, if they wait more than 30 seconds,\n",
            "[02:53:42,810 --> 02:53:43,290]  it's a problem.\n",
            "[02:53:43,290 --> 02:53:44,090]  Even the emails.\n",
            "[02:53:45,130 --> 02:53:47,210]  They said the emails take long to come together.\n",

            "[02:53:47,370 --> 02:53:48,170]  It takes a minute.\n",
            "[02:53:48,170 --> 02:53:48,970]  A minute, 20 seconds.\n",
            "[02:53:48,970 --> 02:53:50,730]  I said, if you catch it at the end,\n",

            "[02:53:57,290 --> 02:53:59,210]  I mean, a lot of mail servers and that...\n",
            "[02:53:59,850 --> 02:54:00,730]  Even our...\n",
            "[02:54:00,730 --> 02:54:02,650]  Our default is 30 minutes.\n",

            "[02:54:17,290 --> 02:54:19,480]  So that's the other component.\n",

            "[02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:27,310]  because on the CloudFront side,\n",
            "[02:54:27,310 --> 02:54:29,150]  we are seeing connections come in\n",
            "[02:54:29,150 --> 02:54:30,190]  and then they just hang.\n",
            "[02:54:30,990 --> 02:54:32,590]  And on the client side,\n",
            "[02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:34,750]  it's making connection to the server,\n",

            "[02:54:42,600 --> 02:54:45,880]  So we suspected a network level problem,\n",
            "[02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:46,280]  but you...\n",
            "[02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:48,120]  Yeah, it's not.\n",
            "[02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:49,080]  And the guys checked it.\n",

            "[02:55:06,490 --> 02:55:08,160]  Okay, I'll ask.\n",
            "[02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:10,880]  Yeah, but the printers...\n",

            "[02:55:19,720 --> 02:55:19,960]  Yeah.\n",
            "[02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:20,760]  More than 40 seconds,\n",
            "[02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:23,320]  then they send mail for you.\n",
            "[02:55:26,430 --> 02:55:28,830]  So we don't know if it's the transaction taking long\n",
            "[02:55:28,830 --> 02:55:30,510]  or if it's Cloud Print because...\n",
            "[02:55:30,510 --> 02:55:31,790]  Yeah, but when you test it,\n",
            "[02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:33,960]  if you've already got a transaction,\n",
            "[02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:35,080]  then you reprint it.\n",
            "[02:55:35,080 --> 02:55:36,840]  But have we told them\n",
            "[02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:40,600]  that it's updating in the background?\n",
            "[02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:43,480]  And what I mean by that statement\n",
